Abstract. We have studied the evolution with tem perature of the boal as well as the average crystal structure ofM gB2 using the real-space atom ic pair distribution function (PDF) m easured by high resolution neutron powder di raction. W e have investigated the correlations of the B B and B M g nearest neighbor pair m otion by com paring, in the wide temperature range from T = 10 K up to T = 600 K , the m eansquare displacem ents (M SD ) of single atom s w ith them ean-square relative displacem ents (M SR D ) obtained from the PDF peak linewidths. The results show that the single atom B and M g vibrations are m ostly decoupled from each other, with a sn all predom inance of positive (in phase) correlation factor for both the B-B and B-M g pairs. The sm all positive correlation is alm ost tem perature independent, in contrast with our theoretical calculations; this can be a direct consequence of the strong decay processes of the E 20 anham onic phonons.

## 1 Introduction

M gB2 is the simplest system to investigate the quantum m echanism that allows the form ation of a superconducting condensate with critical tem perature T。 40 K [1] a factor tw o higher than in all other know n interm etallic superconductors. It was recently proposed by a few groups [2,4,3,5,6] that the enhancem ent of the critical tem perature in M gB 2 is due to the exchange-like interband pairing in a multiband superconductor. There is now experim ental evidence [7,8,9,10,11] that M gB 2 is the rst clear case of a high T c m ultiband superconductor show ing two-gaps in the and bands respectively, in agreem ent with the theory.[12,13]

The characteristic feature ofM gB2 is that the electronphonon interaction gives a weak pairing in the channel and a strong pairing in the -channel. Electronic band calculations,[14,15,16,17,18] Ram an [16,19] and inelastic neutron scattering experim ents [20] provide evidence of an extrem ely large deform ation potential for the B bond stretching m odes, which gives rise to strongly anham onic phonons. This anham onicity also results in a structural instability (phonon softening) that a ects the dynam ics of the lattice uctuations and the local structural properties of the m aterial, as we discuss below . There is now a general agreem ent that this strong electron-phonon cou-

pling is m ainly driven by the interaction between electronic carriers in the 2D - band with boron px;y character and the zone center E 2g phonon m ode.[12,13,14,15,16,17] This is re ected in a K ohn anom aly in the phonon dispersion related to the size of the sm all 2D tubular Ferm i surfaces.[20] The proxim ity of the Ferm i level to the Van Hove singularity (VHs) and to the band edge discloses a new scenario where the large am plitude of the expected boron zero point lattice uctuations [7,12,15,18,21,22] induces large uctuations ofthe sam e order ofthe separation between the V H s, the gap edge and the Ferm i level itself. Although the am plitude of the lattice uctuations seem s thus to be highly relevant for the superconductivity in M gB2 there is a lack of experim ental inform ation on this key point. Furtherm ore, although the average structure (P 6/m m ) of the M gB 2 system has been exhaustively investigated, there is not yet any study of the local structure, since typical x-ray local probes, such as EXAFS, cannot be used to study local structure near light atom s.

In view ofthis, here weem ploy high resolution neutron di raction to obtain the pair distribution function (PDF) ofM gB2. In this way we investigate the localas well as the average structure of M gB2, nam ely the m ean-square displacem ents (M SD ) of single atom s and the m ean-square relative displacem ents (M SRD ). The com parison of these

<span id="page-1-0"></span>quantities perm its for the rst time to extract the correlation factors B B , B M g , de ned below , of the boronboron and boron-m agnesium pairm otions, which are found to be B B B 0:1, в м q 0:1, and nearly constant in a wide range of tem perature 0 K < T < 600 K . W e also com pare the experim ental data w ith a constant force (CF) m odel for the phonon dispersion. W e estim ate that the phonon frequency renorm alization due to the electronphonon interaction on the E 2g m odes yields a reduction 0:03 in the boron-boron correlation factor. в в W hile the CF m odel can nicely account for the zero tem perature values of the single atom s M SD and the correlated M SRD , the tem perature behavior of the correlation factor is shown to be highly anom alous and its physical interpretation gives rise to new questions about our understanding to the local lattice dynam ics in thism aterial.

### 2 Experim entalm ethod and data processing

P olycrystalline sam ples ofM gB2 were synthesized at high tem perature by direct reaction of the elem ents in a tantalum crucible under argon atm osphere using pure 11B isotopes. Time-of- ight neutron powder di raction data were collected on the NPDF di ractom eter at the M anuel Lujan, jr., Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE) at Los A lam os N ational Laboratory. The NPDF di ractom eter, with its high neutron ux and backscattering detector m odules has a high resolution, [24] providing access to a w ide range of m om entum transfer with su ccient counting statistics m aking it ideal for P D F studies. The pow dered sam ples were sealed inside extruded cy lindrical vanadium containers. These were mounted on the stage of a cryofumace with and without heat shield for T < 300 K and T > 300 K , respectively. The scattering data from the empty cryofumace, with and without heat-shield, an empty container mounted on the cryofumace, and the em pty instrum ent were also collected, allow ing us to as sess and subtract instrum ental backgrounds. The scattering from a vanadium rod was also measured to allow the data to be norm alized for the incident spectrum and detector e ciencies.We collected each di raction spectrum up to the high momentum transfer of Q = 40A 1 in 3 hours. The high resolution di raction spectrum so obtained presents both the Bragg peaks and the di use scattering. W hile the Bragg peaks re ect the long-range order of the crystalline sam ples, the oscillating di use scattering contains local structural inform ation including the correlated dynamics.[29,31] The PDF is obtained from a Fourier transform of the powder di raction spectrum (Bragg peaks + di use scattering) .[23] It consists of a se ries of peaks, the positions of which give the distances of atom pairs in the realspace, while the ideal w idth of these peaks is due both to relative them al atom ic m otion and to static disorder. This perm its the study of the e ects of lattice uctuations on PDF peak widths and yields inform ation on both the single atom mean-square displacem ents and the relativem ean-square displacem ents of atom pairs and their correlations.

Standard data corrections [23] were carried out using the program PDFGETN .[25] A fter being corrected, the data were norm alized by the total scattering cross section of the sample to yield the total scattering structure function S (Q). A fterw ards, the total scattering structure function S (Q ) is converted to the PDF , G (r), by m eans of a sine Fourier transform according to the relation :

$$\begin{aligned} \mathbf{G} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{r} \end{pmatrix} &= \mathbf{4} \underset{\mathbf{Z}}{\underset{\mathbf{Z}}{\mathbf{r}}} \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{r} \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{(1)}\\ &= \underbrace{\mathbf{2}}\_{\underset{\mathbf{0}}{\mathbf{0}}} \mathbf{3} \oplus \mathbf{(Q} \mathbf{J} \mathbf{(} \mathbf{J} \mathbf{r}) \mathbf{d} \mathbf{(} \mathbf{r} \mathbf{)} \mathbf{d} \mathbf{Q} : \mathbf{(} \mathbf{J} \mathbf{J} \mathbf{r} \mathbf{d} \end{aligned} \qquad \text{(2)} $$

W e m odeled the PDF using a structuralm odel that takes advantage of the de nition of the radial distribution function RDF R (r), nam ely:

$$\mathbf{R} \cdot \langle \mathbf{r} \rangle = \mathbf{r} \mathbf{G} \cdot \langle \mathbf{r} \rangle + \mathbf{4} \quad \mathbf{r}^2 \quad \mathbf{0} = \underset{\mathbf{i} \neq \mathbf{j}}{\mathbf{k}} \underbrace{\mathbf{b} \mathbf{k} \mathbf{i}^2}\_{\mathbf{i} \mathbf{k} \mathbf{i}^2} \quad \langle \mathbf{r} \quad \mathbf{r} \mathbf{i}\_{\mathbf{j}} \rangle; \qquad \langle \mathbf{Z} \rangle$$

where b; is the scattering length of the ith atom , hbi is the scattering length averaged over the sam ple com position, rij = ji rijis the distance between the if and the jth atom s, and the sum s are taken over all the atom s in the sam ple. Before being com pared to the data, the calculated G (r) is convoluted with a term ination function, sin (0 m ax r)=r to account for the e ects of the nite data collection range. Fundam ental lattice inform ation, such as the average crystal structure, the lattice constants, a scale factor, and the re ned atom ic (them al) displacem ent param eters, can now be extracted from the PDF by using the PDF re nement program PDFFTI [26] that is based on a least-squares approach to t the PDF pro le. The average atom ic displacem ent distribution of atom ialong the major axes x, y, and z, 2 (ix), 2 (ig), 2 (iz), are de ned as

$$\mathbf{f}^{\mathbb{Z}}(\mathbb{L}) = \mathbf{h} \| \mathbf{\upmu}\_{\mathbb{L}} \cdot \mathbb{L} \| \mathbf{\upmu}\_{\mathbb{L}} \| \mathbf{\upmu}\_{\mathbb{L}} \| \mathbf{\upmu}\_{\mathbb{L}} = \mathbf{0} \tag{3}$$

where u; is the lattice displacem ent of atom i from its average position [27] and £ is the unit vector pointing along the direction == x;y;z.Due to the geom etry of these com pounds, the two boron atom s for the unit cell are equivalent and that only four param eters were needed nam ely 2 (Bxy), 2 (Bz ), 2 (M gxy) and 2 (M gz).

### 3 Results and discussion

In F ig. 1 w e show the reduced scattering structure function Q [S (Q ) 1] for the M gB2 at T = 300 K , while the corresponding reduced PDF, G (r), obtained using Eq. (1), is shown in Fig. 2.The features of the NPDF di ractom eter allowed us to obtain high quality PDF's as can be noted by inspecting the modeled t (solid line) of the G (r) in the upper panel Fig. 2. This can be seen also in the lower panelofFig. 2 where most of the uctuations in the di erence curve (solid line) are within the standard deviation on the data di erence curve).

**Caption:** This figure shows the reduced scattering structure function Q[S(Q) - 1] for MgB2 at 300 K, depicting the long-range crystalline order present within the sample. The Bragg peaks extend to high angles, reflecting the crystallinity and minimal disorder within the lattice framework. With atomic displacements elucidated by the structure factor, this data provides crucial information for modeling lattice dynamics and validating theoretical models against experimental results【4:3†temp_paper_1d7b925ec901e3ec150e8a42d815482e.txt】.


F ig . 1 . The reduced structure function Q [S (Q ) 1] for M gB 2 m easured at 300 K .

The P D F 's have been t over the range 1 hexagonal crystal structure (space group P 6/m m m ), and excellent ts were obtained at all tem peratures. The B ragg peaks are clearly persistent up to 25 A 1 , re ecting both the long-range order of the crystalline samples and the sm allam ount of positional (vibrational or static) disorder of the atom s around their average positions.

The lattice param eters at T = 300 K for M gB2 (Tc 39 K ) were found to be a = 3 :08505 (4) A , c = 3 :5218 (1) A . The lattice displacem ents 2 (Bxy), 2 (Bzy), 2 M gxy), 2 M g2 are shown in Fig. 3 (open circles).

#### 3 .1 Atom ic m ean-square displacem ents

In order to extract inform ation about the phonon spectrum , we t each lattice displacem ent with a sim ple E instein model,

$$\mathbf{u}^{\mathcal{Q}} \text{ (i.e.) = } \frac{\mathbf{h}}{\mathbf{M}\_{\pm}!} \mathbf{l}\_{\pm} \text{ } \frac{1}{2} + \text{ in [i.e. (i.e.)] } \mathbf{l}\_{\pm} \text{ } \frac{1}{2} \text{ (i.e.) } \text{ } \mathbf{M}\_{\pm} \text{ } \frac{1}{2}$$

where { (i ) takes into account the static disorder, M i is atom ic m ass of the atom i and ! (i ) provided an estim ate of the vibrational frequency of the atom i along the direction . The quantity n (x) is the Bose them al factor n [x] = [exp (x=kg T ) = 1] + . The values of the tting param eters, ! i and } (i ), are reported in Tab. 1, and the 2 vs. T tting curves are represented by dotted lines in Fig. 3. The di erent values of ! { represent the di erent energy range of the phonon spectra associated with the boron and m agnesium in-plane and out-of-plane lattice vibrations, and they are in good agreem ent with the corresponding spectra reported in Ref. [28].

Quite surprising, we nd that, apart from som eam ount of disorder in { ( ( g2 ), this simple four peak Einstein m odel seem s to describe quite well the lattice vibrations in this com pound. This is quite intriguing because phonon

frequency dispersions are expected to be notably di erent from dispersion less E instein models in these m aterials. M oreover, the E instein ts were obtained by sim ply using an e ective atom ic m ass MM g = 24:3 a m u . for 2 (M g) and MB = 10:81 am u.for 2 (B). This means that we are im plicitly assum ing that m agnesium and boron vibrations are totally decoupled from each other. These twoparam eter ts reproduce the data very well for each of the m otions considered. N on-independent boron and m agnesium vibrations would lead to deviations from E instein behavior that are not evident in the data suqqesting that this approxim ation is reasonable in this system .W e return to this point below .

To gain further insight on this issue we introduce a constant force (CF) shellm odel for the dynam icalm atrix. We neglect for the moment the e ects of the electronphonon interaction, which leads to renorm alized phonon frequencies and anham onicity, and we assum e the lattice

where ¿, is the com ponent of the eigenvector ^q; conceming to the displacem ent of the i atom along the direction and N is the total num ber of q-points considered in the phonon Brillouin zone. From a general point of view , since }n (i ) involves an integral over the whole B rillouin zone and over all the phonon branches, it w ill not be sensitive to the ne details ofthe phonon dispersion but only to its gross features. For this reason, and in order to preserve the simplicity of our analysis, we limit ourselves to consider only four elastic springs, , , , and connecting, respectively, in-plane B-B nearest neighbors, out of plane B B nearest neighbors, out-of-plane B-M g nearest neighbors, and in-plane M q-M g nearest neighbors. Each elastic spring is speci ed by its tensor com ponents (ex .: r r k r ? ) , corresponding respectively to the lattice displacem ents along the radial (bond-stretching) direction and along the in-plane and out-of-plane tangential (bondbending) directions. In M gB 2 we choose the constants rr kı ?ı rı kı ?ı rı kı ?ı rı kı ?ı tı kı ? , to t the local-density functional (LD A ) phonon dispersion of R ef. [16] along the high-sym m etry points of the B rillouin zone. Since the constant force m odel is m eant to reproduce the bare phonon dispersion, we deliberately did not include in the t procedure the E2g phonon frequencies at the zone center , A , which are known to be strongly a ected by the el-ph interaction. The elastic constants obtained from this thing procedure are reported in Table 2.

As mentioned in the introduction, the E2g phonon m odes close to the and A points are expected to be strongly a ected by the interaction with the alm ost 2D parabolic bands, giving rise to a rem arkable softening of the E 2g phonon frequencies for jaj 2Kg , where kr is the Ferm i vector of the bands.[14,15,16,17,20] W e include these e ects through the self-energy renorm alization of the phonon frequencies where N is density of states of the bands per spin and per band, g the electron-phonon m atrix elem ent between -band electrons and the E2q phonon mode at the zone center and fanham is a dim ensionless factor accounting for the anharm onic hardening of the E 2g phonon m odes due to the electron-phonon coupling itself.

**Caption:** This figure depicts phonon dispersion relations and phonon density of states (PDOS) for MgB2 as modeled through the constant force (CF) approach. The solid lines denote calculations accounting for electron-phonon interactions, whereas the dashed lines represent bare phonon dispersion absent of such interactions. A notable shift of spectral weight from 100 meV to 70 meV is observed when electron-phonon coupling is incorporated, demonstrating the softening effects on the E2g phonon modes. This provides insight into the complex interplay between phononic and electronic structures, critical for understanding superconductivity in MgB2【4:1†temp_paper_1d7b925ec901e3ec150e8a42d815482e.txt】.

The phonon dispersion and phonon density of states (PDOS) of our constant force model are shown in Fig. 4, in good agreem ent with the LD A calculations of Ref. [16]. For com parison, the dashed lines represent the bare phonon dispersion in the absence of el-ph interaction and the corresponding PDOS.M ost striking is a partial shift in spectral weight from 100 m eV to 70 m eV when the elph coupling is turned on, due to the softening of the at

A band originating from the E2g phonons.

The lattice displacem ents for each atom and for each direction can now be evaluated directly by m eans ofE q. (5) . T he results are also show n in F ig. 3 along with the data extracted by the PDF analysis and with the simple E instein

ts. In spite of the crude simpli cation of the phonon dispersion, the agreem ent with the PDF data is rem arkable. Just as in the Einstein ts, we nd that a constant shift 2 (M q ) ' 0:0013 A 2 due to intrinsic disorder is needed to account for the magnesium out-of-plane lattice vibration while the contribution of the disorder for the otherm odes is found to be negligible. N ote that the agreem ent between the data and solid lines was obtained with no adjustable param eters. The values used in the constant force m odels in Table 2 were indeed t to reproduce the theoretical LD A calculation and not the P D F data and the only other param eter, the static disorder param eter in { M g2 ), w as the sam e value as was used in the E instein ts. The agree m ent with the data and the Einstein model ts is also very good suggesting that boron and m agnesium lattice vibrations, as well as in-plane and out-of-plane lattice vibrations, are on average independent each other.

To point out the explicit role of the electron-phonon interaction, we show also in the left-upper panel of F ig. 3 the { (Bxy) lattice displacements in the absence of the el ph frequency renorm alization. Since only E 2q phonons are coupled, only the m odi ed.W e note that the inclusion of electron-phonon interaction e ects leads to a slight increase of the am ount of the boron in-plane lattice displacem ents, with a better agreem ent with the experim ental data. The increase of 6 Bxy) is easily understandable as due to the softening of the E2a phonon mode. On the other hand, since the electron-phonon renom alization e ects are restricted to a small region o ok + of , 2kg of the whole Brillouin zone, the im pact ofthe el ph coupling on the totalam ount of the lattice displacem ents going to see, the e ects of the electron-phonon interaction are m ore apparent in the correlated pair m otion .

### 3.2 Correlations in the B-B and B-M g atom ic pairs m otion

A bove we showed that the average uncorrelated them al m otions (equivalent to the Debye W aller factor in crystallography) measured from M gB2 are well explained by ham onic m odels with independent boron and m agnesium m otions. A strength of the P D F technique is that it is sensitive to correlations in the atom ic dynam ics that contain som e additional details about the underlying interatom ic potentials.[27,29,30,31] Here we explore the m otional correlations in the M gB2 PDF data.

The G aussian width ij of the PDF peaks is directly related to the m ean-square relative displacem ent of atom ic pairs projected onto the vector joining the atom pairs.[27] Explicitly,

$$\mathbf{r}\_{\mathbf{i}\uparrow}^2 = \mathbf{h} [\mathfrak{U}\mathbf{u}\_{\mathbf{i}} \quad \mathfrak{u}\_{\mathbf{j}}\rangle \quad \mathfrak{E}\_{\mathbf{i}\uparrow}\mathbf{j}^2 \mathbf{i}\mathbf{j} \tag{6}$$

where u { and u ; are the lattice displacem ents of atom s i and j from their average positions, fij is the unit vector connecting atom s i and j, and where the angular brackets indicate an ensemble average.[27]

In our analysis, we focus on the width of the nearest neighbor boron boron PDF peak, ( } B ), and on the nearest neighborm agnesium -boron peak, ( } M q ). These arew ell resolved single com ponent peaks in the P D F w hose w idth directly yields correlated dynam ical inform ation . [31] The Gaussian widths B B , B M g , as m easured by the PDF data are shown in the upper panels of F ig. 5 (open circles) along with the sam e quantity evaluated w ithin the CF m odel (solid line) according to the relation :

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \mathbf{\hat{i}}^{\text{d}} = \frac{\mathbf{h}^{\text{d}}}{\mathbf{h}} & \mathbf{\hat{j}}^{\text{d}} = \mathbf{h}^{\text{d}} & \mathbf{\hat{i}}^{\text{d}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{j}}^{\text{d}} = \frac{\mathbf{h}^{\text{d}}}{\mathbf{h}} & \mathbf{\hat{j}}^{\text{d}} = \mathbf{h}^{\text{d}} & \mathbf{\hat{i}}^{\text{d}} \end{array} \quad \begin{array}{rcl} \mathbf{\hat{i}}^{\text{d}} & \mathbf{\hat{i}}^{\text{d}} & \mathbf{\hat{j}}^{\text{d}} \end{array} \quad \begin{array}{rcl} \mathbf{\hat{i}}^{\text{d}} & \mathbf{\hat{i}}^{\text{d}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{j}}^{\text{d}} & \mathbf{\hat{j}}^{\text{d}} \end{array}$$

In this latter case in the right panel for also added a sm all contribution of the local lattice displacem ents due to the disorder (see below for more details).

Here we rst note that, while the zero tem perature values of m odel, this m odel is less good than was the case for the uncorrelated m otions, especially at high tem peratures.

**Caption:** Figure 5 illustrates the mean-square relative lattice displacements (σ²ᵢⱼ) for intra-planar boron (B-B, panel a) and inter-planar B-Mg (panel b) atomic motions, derived from PDF peak broadening. The open circles represent experimental values, while solid and dotted lines show model predictions with CF and Einstein frameworks, respectively. Panel c and d display the temperature-dependent pair correlation function (ρᵢⱼ) for B-B and B-Mg, indicating discrepancies between model predictions and observed data. These findings suggest complex underlying interactions not entirely captured by harmonic models, emphasizing the need for incorporating anharmonic effects and electron-phonon interactions to better represent observed phenomena【4:0†temp_paper_1d7b925ec901e3ec150e8a42d815482e.txt】.


F ig.5. M ean-square relative lattice displacem ents <sup>2</sup> <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> (a), 2 <sup>B</sup> M g (b), as extracted from the w idth of the PD F peaks and the corresponding correlation function <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> (c), <sup>B</sup> M g (d) (open circles). Solid lines represent the sam e quantities evaluated w ithin the C F m odel,w hile dotted linesin the upper panels show the predicted relative lattice displacem ents <sup>2</sup> <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> , 2 <sup>B</sup> M g for com pletely uncorrelated lattice m otion <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> = 0, <sup>B</sup> M g = 0. T he dashed lines in the upper panels represent the relative lattice displacem ent <sup>2</sup> <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> and <sup>2</sup> <sup>B</sup> M g evaluated w ithin the C F m odel in the absence of the electron-phonon interaction.

T he tem perature dependence of the single-atom m otionswaswellexplained by them odel,butnotthoseofthe correlated <sup>2</sup> ij,w hich suggests that the m odelis not capturing som e aspectofthe m otionalcorrelations.Introducing the electron-phonon coupling into the m odelim proves the agreem ent slightly, w ith a larger e ect observed on 2 <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> ,but this does notexplain allofthe discrepancy.In each case,thepaircorrelation peaksbroaden m orequickly in the data than in the m odel.W e note that the m odels are harm onic.Even in the case w here we have introduced electron-phonon coupling,harm onicspring constantshave been obtained from a  tto the LD A bandsand we speculatethatthe discrepancy athigh tem peratureisisa result ofanharm onicity in the boron m otion.

A sa generalconsideration,wewould liketo stressonce m ore that w hile <sup>2</sup>(i ) probes the absolute m agnitude of the single atom m ean-square displacem ent, <sup>2</sup> ij provides inform ation aboutthe correlation between the lattice displacem ents of atom pairs. Let us consider for instance the case of <sup>2</sup> <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> w hich involves only boron in-plane lattice 
 uctuations. W e can identify three lim iting behaviors for this quantity: i) perfectly in-phase lattice m otion:ii) perfectly opposite-phase m otion;iii) com pletely independent m otion. In the  rst case it is easy to see that <sup>2</sup> <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> = 0,w hile <sup>2</sup> <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> = 2 <sup>2</sup>(Bxy) w hen the nearestneighborboron lattice displacem entsareuncorrelated, and <sup>2</sup> <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> = 4 <sup>2</sup>(Bxy) w hen they have opposite phase.

To form alize this we rearrange Eq.[\(6\)](#page-4-0) as

$$\mathbf{f}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}}^{2} = \mathbf{h} \| \mathbf{\hat{u}}\_{\mathbf{i}} \mathbf{f}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}} \| \mathbf{\hat{j}}^{2} \mathbf{i} + \mathbf{h} \| \mathbf{\hat{u}}\_{\mathbf{j}} \mathbf{f}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}} \| ^{2} \mathbf{i} \quad \mathbf{2h} \langle \mathbf{u}\_{\mathbf{i}} \ \mathbf{f}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}} \rangle \quad \langle \mathbf{\hat{y}}\_{\mathbf{i}} \ \mathbf{f}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}} \rangle \mathbf{i} \mathbf{i} \tag{8}$$

H ere the  rst two term s are related to m ean-square therm al displacem ent of atom s i and j projected along ^rij, w hilethethird term isa displacem entcorrelation function, w hich carriesinform ation aboutthem otionalcorrelations. It is now usefulto quantify the degree ofcorrelation by introducing the dim ensionless correlation param eter ij de ned as[:\[33,29,31,32](#page-7-0)]

$$\mathbf{r}\_{\rm ij}^2 = \mathbf{r}\_{\rm i}\mathbf{\hat{t}}\_{\rm j}\mathbf{\hat{t}} + \mathbf{r}\_{\rm i}\mathbf{\hat{t}}\mathbf{\hat{t}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{t}}\_{\rm j} \quad \mathbf{\hat{t}}\_{\rm j} \quad \mathbf{\hat{t}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{z}} \quad \$$

w here <sup>2</sup>(ij) = h[(u<sup>i</sup> ^rij] <sup>2</sup>i.Positive values of > 0 describe a situation w here the atom sm ove in phase,so that the resulting value of <sup>2</sup> ij is sm aller than for the uncorrelated case.O n theotherhand,a predom inanceofopposite phase atom ic vibrations should result in < 0 and in a PD F peak w idth <sup>2</sup> ij largerthan the uncorrelated case.

Itisim portantto notethatthecorrelation function ij in Eq.(9)expressesthe degree ofcorrelation between the totalatom icdisplacem ents.In thepresenceoftwo di erent sourcesoflattice displacem ents(phononsand disorder),it ism oreconvenientto split <sup>2</sup> ij into a phonon and a disorder contribution.A ssum ing thelocallatticedisplacem entsdue to the disorderto be uncorrelated,we can w rite thus:

$$\begin{aligned} \mathbf{^2\_{ij}} &= \begin{array}{ccccc} & \mathbf{^2\_{ph}} \ (\mathbf{\dot{^2\_j}}) + & \mathbf{^2\_{ph}} \ (\mathbf{\dot{^2\_j}}) & \mathbf{2}\_{\mathbf{^2\_{ph}}} \ (\mathbf{\dot{^2\_j}}) & \mathbf{^2\_{ph}} \ (\mathbf{\dot{^2\_i}}) & \mathbf{\dot{^2\_i}} \\ + & \mathbf{^2\_0} \ (\mathbf{\dot{^2\_j}}) + & \mathbf{^2\_0} \ (\mathbf{\dot{^2\_k}}) & \mathbf{\dot{^2\_k}} \end{array} \end{aligned} \tag{10}$$

w here ij represents now only the correlation between phononic lattice displacem ents.

U sing Eq.(10) the correlation param eter can be calculated from the totalw idth ofthe PD F peak as

$$\mathbf{j}\_{\rm ij} = \frac{\mathbf{\stackrel{2}{\rm ph} \ (\mathbf{\dot{j}}\_{\rm j}) + \ \mathbf{\stackrel{2}{\rm ph} \ (\mathbf{\dot{j}}\_{\rm i}) + \ \mathbf{\stackrel{2}{\rm p} \ (\mathbf{\dot{r}}\_{\rm j}) + \ \mathbf{\stackrel{2}{\rm p} \ (\mathbf{\dot{j}}\_{\rm i})} \ \mathbf{\stackrel{2}{\rm p} \ (\mathbf{\dot{j}}\_{\rm i})}}{2 \ \mathbf{\stackrel{2}{\rm p} \ (\mathbf{\dot{r}}\_{\rm j}) \ \mathbf{\stackrel{2}{\rm p} \ (\mathbf{\dot{j}}\_{\rm i})}}} ; \quad \text{(11)}$$

Finally,the projected atom ic m ean-square displacem ents <sup>2</sup>(ij)(lattice vibrationsalong the pair^rij direction)can be related to <sup>2</sup> <sup>i</sup> (lattice vibrations along the C artesian axes)by sim ple geom etricalconsiderations.W e have thus 2 ph(B<sup>B</sup> )= <sup>2</sup> ph(Bxy), <sup>2</sup> ph(BM g)= [4R 2 2 ph(Bxy)+ 3 <sup>2</sup> ph(Bz)]=(4R 2+ 3), <sup>2</sup> ph(M g<sup>B</sup> )= [4R 2 2 ph(M gxy)+ 3 <sup>2</sup> ph(M gz)]=(4R <sup>2</sup> + 3), w hereR = a=c= 0:88 and w here a and care the in-plane and out-of-plane lattice constants.Sim ilar relations hold true for the disordercontributions.

T he phonon correlation factor ij as extracted from the PD F data <sup>2</sup> <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> , 2 <sup>B</sup> M g , and from the single atom m ean-square lattice displacem ents <sup>2</sup>(i ) is show n in the lowerpanelsofFig.5 (open circles),togetherw ith thecorresponding correlation factor predicted by the C F m odel (solid lines). In order to extract the experim ental value of <sup>B</sup> M g we have taken into accounta slightm agnesium disorderalong the c axis, <sup>2</sup> <sup>0</sup>(M gz)= 0:0013 A <sup>2</sup>,in agreem entw ith the previousanalysisofthe m ean square absolute displacem ents <sup>2</sup>(i ).W e  nd a positive correlation factorforboth <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> 0:1 and <sup>B</sup> M g 0:1,indicating a

A nother anom alous feature of M gB<sup>2</sup> pointed out by this analysis is the lack ofa tem perature dependence for thecorrelation factors ij ascom pared w ith theC F m odel and w ith thestandard behaviorofothercom m on m aterials[.\[31\]](#page-7-0) A n increase of ij as function of tem perature is indeed observed in m any covalently bonded system s and it is essentially due to the fact that the therm alpopulation of the low frequency in-phase phonon m odes is larger than the high frequency out-of-phase phonon m odes.T he lack ofthis tem perature dependence in our m easurem entscan m aybe be attributed to the anharm onic character ofthe high frequency (E2g) B-B m odes and it represents an interesting anom aly in this m aterialw hose physicalinterpretation can shed interesting lighton the lattice dynam ics in M gB2.Further work on this subjectis required.A s a  nal point, we can quantify in our m odel the role of the electron-phonon coupling on the correlation factors.

# 4 Conclusions

In this work we have investigated the locallattice propertiesofM gB<sup>2</sup> paying specialattention on the lattice dynam ics and the correlations in the B-B and B-M g  rst neighboratom ic pairm otion.W e have used the realspace PD F obtained from high resolution neutron di raction to study thee ectsofthelatticevibrationson thePD F peak w idths.T he PD F peaks in wellordered crystals such as the present case yield im portant inform ation about the underlying atom ic potentials through the correlated locallattice dynam ics.T he data have been m odeled using both a m ulti-param eter constant force m odeland a sim pleEinstein m odel.W e havefound thattheconstantforce m odelas wellas the Einstein one reproduce the average featuresofthe lattice vibrations.T hisagreem entsuggests that boron and m agnesium displacem ents,both in-plane and out-of-plane,are m ostly independent of each other. T heanalysisofthePD F peak linew idthsperm itsto evaluate the correlation forboth the nearestneighborB-B and B-M g atom ic pairs.W e  nd a sm allpositive correlation factor <sup>B</sup> <sup>B</sup> 0:1 and <sup>B</sup> M g 0:1,nearly tem perature independent,indicating a weakly prevalent in-phase relative atom ic m otion.T hese resultsare in contrastw ith C F
