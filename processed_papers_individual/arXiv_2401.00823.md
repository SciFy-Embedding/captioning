## **Abstract**

Experimental discovery of near-room-temperature superconductivity in highly compressed hydrogen sulphate started a new era in superconductivity. To date, researchers have made the discovery of dozens of superconducting hydride phases with transition temperatures above LN2. While the primary focus of the research in this field is to determine fundamental superconducting parameters of these superconductors, here we revealed primary applied property of these superconductors which is the field dependence of transport critical current, *I*c(*B*,*T*). We analysed reported *V*(*I*) curves for a highly compressed CeH<sup>9</sup> sample with *T*<sup>c</sup> = 70 K, and showed that this hydride exhibits practically identical *I*c(*B*,*T*) to HTS 1G-wire (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3O11. Additionally, we demonstrated that the n-value in CeH<sup>9</sup> superhydride follows a nearly identical dependence on critical current, as observed in Nb3Sn conductors.

# **In-Field Transport Critical Currents in Superhydride Superconductors: Highly-Compressed CeH<sup>9</sup>**

### **I. Introduction**

Experimental studies of near-room-temperature superconductors started after pivotal discovery of the superconducting state above 200 K in highly-compressed sulfur hydride by Drozdov *et al* [1] in 2015. To date, dozens of highly-compressed high-temperature superconducting hydrides have been discovered [2]–[12]. While fundamental properties/parameters of the superconducting state of the superhydrides (which are the lower critical field [1], [13], the upper critical field [14]–[17], the charge carriers density [14], [16], the London penetration depth [1], [13], [18], the coherence length [14], [16], [17], the Ginzburg-Landau parameter [13], [18]–[20], the Ginzburg-Levanyuk number [18], the energy gap [16], [21], [22], specific heat jump at the transition temperature [21], [22], the self-field critical current density [16] have been measured/extracted from experimental data), primary applied property of any superconductors, which is in-field transport critical current, *I*c(*B*,*T*), and its density, *J*c(*B*,*T*), are remaining to be practically unknown.

It should be noted that many experimental techniques utilized to measure temperature dependent superconducting gap, Δ(), in low-temperature and high-temperature superconductors [23] are not applicable for highly compressed materials. However, the amplitude of the ground state energy gap, Δ(0), can be extracted from the self-field critical current density, *J*c(*sf*,*T*) [24]–[27], and the upper critical field *B*c2(*T*) [22], [28]. Until recent report by Semenok *et al* [15], available *I*c(*B*,*T*) and *J*c(*B*,*T*) data for superhydrides were limited by the values measured at *T* ~ *T*<sup>c</sup> [7], [9].

CeH<sup>9</sup> phase exhibits maximal transition temperature of *T*<sup>c</sup> = 102 K at applied pressure of *P* = 130 GPa [15]. In this study we analyzed *V*(*I*) curves measured in highly compressed CeH<sup>9</sup> sample (*P* = 125 GPa, *T*<sup>c</sup> = 70 K) by Semenok *et al* [15]. It should be noted that

Semenok *et al* [14] used four-probe AC method with the excitation current of 5-10 mA to measure *V*(*I*) curves, while in the applied superconductivity many research groups utilize DC transport current measurements to study HTS 2G-wires [29]. We made a comparison of the derived *I*c(*B*,*T*) data based on the electric field criterion of *E*<sup>c</sup> = 1 V/cm with the field dependent critical current measured in well-studied superconductors.

In this study we showed that:

- 1. Reduced critical currents, *I*c(*B*,*T*)/*I*c(*B=1 Tesla*,*T*), in CeH<sup>9</sup> (*P* = 125 GPa) and 1Gwire (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3O<sup>11</sup> are practically identical;
- 2. The dependence of *n*-values from critical current, *n*(*I*c), in CeH<sup>9</sup> (*P* = 125 GPa) and Nb3Sn are nearly identical.

#### **II. Utilized model**

Critical currents can be derived by the fit of measured *V*(*I*) (or *E*(*I*)) curves to the power law[30]–[32]:

$$E(I) = E\_c \times \left(\frac{I}{\iota\_c}\right)^n,\tag{1}$$

where is the electric field criterion, and is the so-called *n*-value which is one of the characteristics of the transition from dissipative-less to dissipative regimes of the transport current flow in superconductors. To utilize widely used the electric field criterion value of = 1 ⁄ [33]–[35] for CeH9, the following approach was used.

Considering geometrical arrangements of experiments in the report by Semenok *et al* [15], we approximated the distance between voltage taps (electrodes) in diamond anvil cell (DAC) as = 50 . At the same time, the noise of electronics of the measured *V*(*I*) curves [15] was at the same level (< 10-7 V) as it is in many other transport critical current measuring systems [36]–[42]. Based on that, we fitted measured *V*(*I*) curves [15] to the equation:

$$V(I) = V\_0 + V\_c \times \left(\frac{I}{\iota\_{c,V}}\right)^n,\tag{2}$$

where <sup>0</sup> is an instrumental offset, and = 1 . Derived , was recalculated to the by the equation:

$$I\_c = \left(\frac{50\,\mu m}{1\,cm}\right)^{\frac{1}{n}} \times I\_{c,V} \,. \tag{3}$$

Theoretical interpretation of *n*-value in polycrystalline superconductors can be found elsewhere [30]–[32], [43].

#### **III. Results and Discussion**

Fits of several *V*(*I*) curves of CeH<sup>9</sup> (*P* = 125 GPa) reported by Semenok *et al* [15] to Eq. 2 are shown in Fig. 1. We analyzed reported *V*(*I*) curves measured for CeH<sup>9</sup> sample with *T*<sup>c</sup> = 70 K. All performed fits (included fits which are not shown in Fig. 1) have a high quality (the coefficient of determination (*R*-Squared)) for each curve is better than *R* = 0.972, and for majority of the fits *R* > 0.99).

Derived *I*c(*B*,*T=55K*) dataset (in the reduced *I*c(*B*,*T*)/*I*c(*B=0.95 Tesla*,*T*) form) are shown in Fig. 2.

It should be noted that CeH<sup>9</sup> samples studied by Semenok *et al* [15] were polycrystalline samples (which can be confirmed by XRD data presented in the study [15]) with *T*<sup>c</sup> = 70-102 K. Based on that, it is useful to make a comparison of the deduced *I*c(*B*,*T*)/*I*c(*B=0.95 Tesla*,*T*) with the *I*c(*B*,*T*)/*I*c(*B=1.0 Tesla*,*T*) measured in HTS 1G-wires (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3O11, which are also polycrystalline samples with *T*<sup>c</sup> in the same ballpark (*I*c(*B*,*T*) data for 1G-wires reported by Wimbush and Strickland [29]). This comparison is shown in Fig. 2, where nearly identical in-field transport current dependence CeH<sup>9</sup> (*P* = 125 GPa) and two HTS 1G-wires can be seen.

**Caption:** Figure 1 displays the voltage (V) versus current (I) characteristics for CeH9 under a pressure of 125 GPa at different magnetic fields (B = 0.95 T, 1.95 T, 2.85 T, 4.75 T) at temperatures T = 55 K, 51.4 K, and 49.5 K. The y-axis represents voltage in microvolts (µV), and the x-axis represents current in milliamperes (mA). The figure consists of three subplots (a, b, c) for each temperature. The voltage criterion Vc=1 mV (or Ec=200 µV/cm) is indicated. The curves depict a non-linear relationship under varying magnetic fields, which is critical to understanding the electric field vs. current relationship, particularly how the critical current pathway changes under different B and T conditions in CeH9. This analysis follows fitting to the equation V(I) = Vo + Vc(I/Ic)^n, which is typical in superconductor characterization .


**Figure 1.** Fits of the *V*(*I*) curves measured in CeH<sup>9</sup> (*P* = 125 GPa) by Semenok *et al* [15] to Eq. 2. Raw *V*(*I*) datasets are from Figure S6 [15]. Utilized voltage criterion of *V*<sup>c</sup> = 1 mV (or field criterion *E*<sup>c</sup> = 200 mV/cm) is shown. The pink shadow areas indicate 95% confidence bands for the fit to Eq. 2.

The analysis of *n*-value (Eq. 1) this is a standard practice [44]–[46] in superconductors characterization. In Fig. 3 we showed field dependence of the *n*-values for CeH<sup>9</sup> (*P* = 125 GPa) and two HTS 1G-wires.

**Caption:** Figure 2 presents reduced in-field critical currents for CeH9 at 125 GPa and HTS 1G-wires (Bi-2223-Sumitomo and Bi-2223-InnoST) at T = 40 K and T = 55 K, respectively. The reduced critical current ratio is plotted on the y-axis against the applied field (T) on the x-axis. Both the CeH9 and HTS wires show a decrease in critical current with increasing applied fields, emphasizing similarities in in-field behavior between this novel high-pressure superhydride and traditional high Tc superconductors like Bi-2223. These results validate the robustness of CeH9's superconducting properties under applied fields, suggesting potential practical applications in magnet-heavy environments .

Blue – Sumitomo 1G-HTS wire (data by Wimbush and Strickland [29]). Green – InnoST 1G-HTS wire (data by Wimbush and Strickland [29]). Red - CeH<sup>9</sup> (*P* = 125 GPa), raw *V*(*I*) datasets reported by Semenok *et al* [15] in their Figure S6.

**Caption:** Figure 3 illustrates the n-value field dependence for CeH9 at P = 125 GPa and other superconductors at T = 45 K (Bi-2223-Sumitomo, Bi-2223-InnoST) and CeH9 at T = 49.5 K. The x-axis plots the applied magnetic field (T) and the y-axis the n-value, a parameter indicative of the transition from a superconducting to a resistive state. The comparison shows lower n-values at higher fields across all samples, highlighting the deterioration of superconducting condensation under magnetic stress, which is a key to understanding the current carrying capacity and the stability of high-temperature superconductors like CeH9 under magnetic fields .


**Figure 3.** Field dependence of *N*-values for 1G-HTS wires (data by Wimbush and Strickland [29]) and CeH<sup>9</sup> (*P* = 125 GPa) (raw *V*(*I*) datasets reported by Semenok *et al* [15]).
Further analysis is shown in Fig. 4, where the *n*(*I*c) dependences were fitted to the power law [45]:

$$m(l\_c) = 1 + a \times (l\_c)^s \tag{4}$$

where *a* and *s* are free-fitting parameters. More details about parameter *s* can be found elsewhere [47].

**Caption:** Figure 4 depicts the correlation between the n-value and the critical current (Ic) for CeH9 under conditions of high pressure (125 GPa) across different temperatures (a: 55 K, b: 51.4 K, c: 49.5 K). The critical current is marked along the x-axis (mA), whereas the n-value is along the y-axis. The red shaded region represents the confidence bands for the fit, incorporating the formula n(Ic)=1 + a(Ic)^s, indicating the power law relationship. The deduced power law exponents (s) range between 0.41 to 0.52, correlating closely with data for polycrystalline Nb3Sn, signifying similarities in the superconducting characteristics between CeH9 under pressures and more traditional superconductors .


**Figure 4.** ( ) dependences and data fits to Eq. 4 for CeH<sup>9</sup> (*P* = 125 GPa) (raw *V*(*I*) datasets reported by Semenok *et al* [15]). The pink shadow areas indicate 95% confidence bands for the fit to Eq. 4. 

It is important to note that deduced 0.41 ≤ ≤ 0.52 (Fig. 4) for CeH<sup>9</sup> (*P* = 125 GPa) are in the same ballpark values for reported by Taylor and Hampshire [45] for polycrystalline Nb3Sn wires (0.38 ≤ ≤ 0.44).

## **IV. Conclusions**

In this study we analyzed the only available in-field high-current *V*(*I*) curves measured in highly-compressed hydrides. In the result, we derived the in-field transport critical current *I*c(*B*,*T*) for CeH<sup>9</sup> (*P* = 125 GPa) hydride and showed that its field dependence is similar to one measured in polycrystalline HTS 1G-wires (Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3O11. We also showed that the power-law exponent *s* in the dependence of the *n*-value vs the critical current is close to the power-law exponent in Nb3Sn.
