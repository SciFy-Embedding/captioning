#### Abstract

We prepared three types of non-Cu RHQ-Nb3Al wire samples with different matrix structures: an all-Ta matrix, a composite matrix of Nb and Ta with a Ta inter filament, and an all-Nb matrix. Neutron diffraction patterns of the wire samples were measured at room temperature in J-PARC "TAKUMI." To obtain residual strains of materials, we estimated lattice constant a by multi-peak analysis in the wire. Powder sample of each wire was measured, where the powder was considered to be strain-free. The grain size of all the powder samples was below 0.02 mm. For wire sample with the all-Nb matrix, we also obtained lattice spacing d by a single-peak analysis. Residual strains of Nb3Al filament were estimated from the two analysis results and were compared. Result, residual strains obtained from the multi-peak analysis showed a good accuracy with small standard deviation. The multi-peak analysis results for the residual strains of Nb3Al filament in the three samples were all tensile residual strain in the axial direction, they are 0.12%, 0.12%, and 0.05% for the all-Ta matrix, the composite matrix, and the all-Nb matrix, respectively. Difference in the residual strain of Nb3Al filament between the composite and all-Nb matrix samples indicates that type of inter-filament materials show a great effect on the residual strain. In this paper, we report the method of measurement, method of analysis, and results for residual strain in the tree types of non-Cu RHO-Nb3Al wires.

## 1 Introduction

Nb3Al has advantages of better tolerance to strain/stress for stoichiometric composition over Nb3Sn. The rapidheating, quenching and transformation annealing (RHQ) process enables to form a stoichiometric Nb3Al with fine grain structures via metastable bcc supersaturated-solidsolution. As a result a large critical current density of RHQ-Nb3Al is achieved over the whole range of magnetic fields. The RHQ-Nb3Al conductor is very promising for high-field applications such as particle accelerator, fusion reactor, and NMR. Development of the RHQ-Nb3Al wires has been reported by Takeuchi et al.[1-5]. The critical current I<sup>c</sup> of A15-type superconducting wires such as Nb3Al and Nb3Sn dependent on the tensile strain. Banno et al. reported that I<sup>c</sup> of RHQ-Nb3Al wires decreases with an increase in the tensile strain[\[6\]](#page-6-0).

Since RHQ-Nb3Al wires are composites, thermal phase stress during sample preparation (heat treatment) can be generated due to difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) among constituent phases. The thermal stresses are also different for samples with different matrix. At the room temperature, the Nb3Al filament has residual strain induced by the difference in the thermal contraction between the filament and the matrix material during cool-down from the heat treatment to the room temperature. It is important to study the residual strain of RHQ-Nb3Al to thoroughly understand its J<sup>c</sup> dependence on the strain, but it has not been studied yet. The CTE of Nb3Al is smaller than that of Cu and larger than that of Ta or Nb[\[7,](#page-6-1) [8\]](#page-6-2). Therefore, the residual strain of Nb3Al filament is determined by the complicated interaction with the compressive and the tensile stresses by the Cu stabilizer and the Ta or Nb matrix. To understand the mechanism of generation of the residual strain in RHQ-Nb3Al wires, it is necessary to investigate the effect of each component. In this study, we focused on the dependence of this residual strain on the matrix structure at room temperature. For this purpose, the Cu plating was removed after heat treatment for Nb3Al phase transformation.

Residual strain of Nb3Sn in bronze processed Nb3Sn wire has been estimated to be about -0.2 – -0.1% at the room temperature by a single-peak analysis in the axial direction[\[9,](#page-6-3) [10\]](#page-6-4). The residual strain of Nb3Sn was shown to have a significant effect by Cu. The CTE of Nb3Sn is smaller than that of Cu by 9.6 × 10<sup>−</sup><sup>6</sup> K<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> . This difference is about four times larger than the difference between the CTEs of Nb3Al and Ta (or Nb) in non-Cu Nb3Al wires. Considering only the magnitude of strain in the axial direction, the residual strain of Nb3Al filament in the RHQ-Nb3Al wires was expected to be smaller than that of Nb3Sn in the bronze processed Nb3Sn wires. Thus, high precision is necessary for analyzing the residual strain in RHQ-Nb3Al wires.

## 2 Experimental

#### 2.1 Sample preparation

We prepared three types of the RHQ-Nb3Al wire samples without Cu stabilizer and with different matrix materials (samples A, B, and C). Main parameters are summarized as shown in Table [1.](#page-1-0) The cross section of sample A is shown in Fig. [1.](#page-1-1)

The following is the sample preparation process. Firstly, a mono filament was prepared by the jelly-roll method[\[2\]](#page-6-5). Nb and Al sheets with a stoichiometric composition were rolled onto a pure Nb or a pure Ta core. The mono filament was bundled into a Cu conduit with Ta or Nb matrix, and a multi filament was fabricated by the wire drawing process. After drawing the wires, the Cu conduit was removed, and they were heated to above 2000 ◦C by RHQ treatment. Then, the Cu stabilizer was plated. The crosssectional diameter of the drawn wires was 1 mm, and they were heated at 800 ◦C for 10 h. Finally, the Cu plating was removed.

To determine the residual strain of the Nb3Al filament in the composite, a sample representing a strain-free state is necessary. Since removal of the Ta or Nb matrix surrounding the Nb3Al filament is very difficult, the samples A, B and C were powderized. The powder samples were prepared with a particle size below 0.02 mm to achieve a strain-free state.

#### 2.2 Sample measurements

The "TAKUMI", a time-of-flight (TOF) neutron diffractometer at MLF/J-PARC, was chosen to conduct this study[\[11,](#page-6-6) [12\]](#page-6-7). Multiple peaks in the diffraction pattern were measured simultaneously using two fixed detectors placed at two opposite banks whose diffraction angles with respect to the incident beam were fixed to be -90◦ and 90◦ . Therefore, the diffraction patterns for the wire in the transverse and axial lattice directions can be obtained simultaneously for a beam incident angle of 45◦ , as shown in Fig. [2.](#page-2-0)

For neutron diffraction measurement, seven wires of 20 mm length were bundled. The measurements were performed at room temperature, and time for a single measurement was 20 minutes. To confirm the efficacy of multipeak analysis by comparing with the single-peak analysis, the sample C was measured four times under the same measurement conditions. There may be slight differences in position among the four measurements because multiple samples were set on the goniometer and they were scanned through the measurement. Measurement for the powder samples in sealed cylindrical aluminum holders were carried out by using a radial collimator of 2 mm width[\[13\]](#page-6-8). The bore and outer diameters of all the aluminum holders are 8 and 10 mm, respectively. Calibration of TOF and lattice spacing d was performed using CeO<sup>2</sup> powder as a standard sample certificated by NIST, and conversion parameters were determined. Because the volume fraction of Nb3Al was small in all the samples, we used the high intensity mode with a sample-slit width of 5 mm for the incident neutron beam.. The experiments were conducted at a proton beam power of 120 kW.

**Caption:** Figure 3: Neutron diffraction patterns of wire samples alongside powder simulations for Nb3Al, Ta, and Nb, detailing (d, Å) results. This figure demonstrates that Nb3Al and its matrix components, Ta and Nb, were present without impurities in sample A, as substantiated by observer and simulation overlay. This supports the prepared samples' high purity and the method's capacity to discern phase compositions, critical for understanding stress-strain behaviors in superconducting materials .

## 3 Results and discussion

#### 3.1 Neutron diffraction patterns

Neutron diffraction patterns of the wire samples are shown in Fig. [3.](#page-2-1) The powder neutron diffraction simulations of Nb3Al, Ta, and Nb were calculated by using Rietan 2000[\[14\]](#page-6-9). In all the patterns, the Nb3Al and matrix material (Ta or Nb) phases were observed without any impurity phase. All the samples showed a difference in the relative intensity ratio of each hkl peak between the transverse and axial directions. This difference indicates that crystallites in the RHQ-Nb3Al wires have preferred orientation.

#### 3.2 Multi-peak analysis and results

To obtain the residual strain, we firstly determined lattice constant by a multi-peak analysis for a specific phase in the neutron diffraction pattern. In this study, we applied the multi-peak analysis to the composite wires. The lattice constant a<sup>m</sup> of the wire determined by the multi-peak analysis was fitted by using Z-Rietveld (ver. 0.9.34) for more than 10 peaks[\[16\]](#page-6-10). The Z-Rietveld was developed for Reitveld analysis of powder sample, it is also can fit to non-powder model by setting each peak on independence.

From diffraction patterns in the axial and transverse directions in Fig. [3](#page-2-1) , it is clearly shown that the wire samples have strong textures. Therefore, the intensity of each peak for a phase was fitted as a free fitting parameter

**Caption:** Figure 4: Neutron diffraction pattern alongside multi-peak analysis results for sample A in the transverse direction. Intensity (a.u.) is plotted against time of flight (TOF, μs). The observed pattern is shown against the fitted pattern, with the delta indicating discrepancies. Analyzed peak positions of Nb3Al and Ta are marked with vertical lines. This figure illustrates that the composite wire samples exhibit preferred crystallographic orientations, emphasizing the necessity of accounting for these effects in accurate strain measurements.

without using random model or any preferred orientation function. This is different from Rietveld analysis.

Cubic crystal structure of Nb3Al can deformed to the non-cubic structures under anisotropic lattice strain in the composite wire. To estimate the lattice constant am, the lattice spacings d of each hkl peak were fitted by the linear least-square method that was simulated to lattice space group Pm¯3<sup>n</sup> of the powder. Therefore, this is statistical analysis by unification of lattice structures.

The powder samples were also analyzed by the multipeak analysis. The peak intensities also were fitted in independence of each peak. The lattice constant for powder sample was defined as a0.

As an example, the analysis results for the sample A comprised of all Ta matrix in transverse and axial directions are shown in Figs. [4](#page-3-0) and [5,](#page-3-1) respectively. The differences in the intensities between the measured and the fitted patterns (deltas) have small scatters, indicating a good fitting. The fitted peak positions of Nb3Al and Ta are shown in the figures with vertical lines.

Table [2](#page-3-2) shows the lattice constants a<sup>m</sup> and a<sup>0</sup> for the wire and powder samples, respectively. All the lattice constants a<sup>m</sup> were larger than the corresponding lattice constant a0. This indicates that the Nb3Al lattice was extended along the transverse and axial directions in all the wire samples.

The residual strain ǫ by the multi-peak analysis is given as

$$
\epsilon = \frac{a\_{\rm m} - a\_0}{a\_0}.
$$

#### 3.3 Comparison with single-peak analysis

In order to confirm the efficacy of multi-peak analysis, the comparison with single-peak analysis was carried out.

|--------|----------|------------|------------|------------|--|--|--|
|        |          | transverse | 5.1877     |            |  |  |  |

|        |          | axial      | 5.1919     |            |  |  |  |
| C      |          | transverse | 5.1867     |            |  |  |  |
|        | Nb3Al    | axial      | 5.1887     | 5.1860     |  |  |  |
|        |          | transverse | 3.3004     |            |  |  |  |
|        | Nb       | axial      | 3.2991     | 3.3019     |  |  |  |

The lattice spacing d for the 211, 320 and 321 peaks of Nb3Al in the sample C and its powder was estimated in the axial direction with Gaussian fitting. In the single-peak analysis, we defined the lattice spacing of the wire and powder samples as d<sup>s</sup> and d0, respectively. By considering the powder samples to be strain-free, the residual strains ǫ can be evaluated by

$$
\epsilon = \frac{d\_{\rm s} - d\_0}{d\_0}.
$$

In the four measurement of the sample C, results for residual strain obtained by the single-peak and multi-peak analyses were shown in Fig. [6.](#page-4-0) The dashed line shows the averaged residual strain of the four measurements for the 211 peak, 320 peak, 321 peak, and multi-peak as 0.051%, 0.035%, 0.011%, and 0.045%, respectively. The variations in single-peak analysis results indicate that residual strain depends on the hkl peaks, it maybe related

The vertical axis represents the calculated residual strain percentage (ε, %), while the horizontal bars for 211, 320, 321 single peak, and multi-peak analyses show sequential measurements (1st to 4th). The dashed line indicates the average residual strain of the four measurements, quantified respectively as 0.051%, 0.035%, 0.011%, and 0.045%. Error bars represent the standard deviation, demonstrating a higher precision in multi-peak over single-peak analysis, indicative of the multi-peak method's ability to yield macroscopic residual strain values with improved statistical reliability, important for applications requiring precise stress-strain characterization.

to different diffraction elastic stiffness[\[15\]](#page-6-11). Considering these variation in hkl peaks, residual strains analyzed from multi-peak analysis method show weighted-averaged values which may express macroscopic residual strains. The standard deviation of the four residual strains obtained from the multi-peak analysis is 0.001%. This value is 3–9 times smaller than that obtained from single-peak analysis. It indicates that statistics by multi-peak analysis in wire certainly is valid and feasible to improve accuracy.

### 3.4 Residual strains in wire with different matrix

In the samples A, B, and C, the residual strains of the Nb3Al filament obtained from the multi-peak analysis are shown in Fig. [7](#page-5-0) with the corresponding cross section of wire. The values of error bars were obtained by summation of systematic error 0.1% and the error obtained from Z-Rietveld. All the residual strains had tensile strain at the axial direction. In all the samples, the residual strains of Nb3Al filament in the axial direction were larger than that in the transverse direction. It indicates that thermal stress shows a significant effect in the axial direction. Similar behavior can be seen in strain distribution of the Nb3Sn[\[10\]](#page-6-4).

In the given direction, the samples A and B showed almost the same residual strain in the Nb3Al filament. This result indicates that the residual strain of the Nb3Al filament is dominantly influenced by the adjacent interfilament matrix of Ta and the effects of the skin, core, and center dummy are relatively small. The residual strain of the Nb3Al filament in the sample B was larger than that in the sample C by about 0.08 % and 0.02 % in the axial and transverse directions, respectively. The residual strain of Nb3Al filament has a great dependence on the materials of inter-filament.

We also estimated the residual strain of the matrixes of Ta and Nb by the multi-peak analysis. The crystal structures of Ta and Nb have the same space group Pm¯3<sup>n</sup> and almost same parameters. Thus, it is difficult to distinguish Ta and Nb peaks in the diffraction patterns of the sample B in which both Ta and Nb are utilized for the matrix materials. The analysis results for the matrix materials in the samples A and C are shown in Fig. [7.](#page-5-0) In the transverse direction, the Ta and Nb show tensile and compressive residual strain, respectively. It indicates the samples A and C have different generation mechanisms of residual strain in the transverse direction.

### 3.5 Model calculation of residual strain induced by thermal contraction

We calculated residual strains of Nb3Al filament and matrix materials by a thermal contraction model for samples A and C in the axial direction. In this model, the transverse strains were assumed to have no effect on the axial strains. During heat treatment, as the temperature decreased below 800 ◦C, axial residual strain was assumed to be generated 550 ◦C (TH)[\[15,](#page-6-11) [17\]](#page-6-12). Then, as temperature decreased to room temperature (TR), the residual strain increased with an increase in the stress between the Nb3Al filament and the matrix material owing to the difference in their CTE.

CTE of Nb3Al is larger than that of Ta or Nb; therefore, the Nb3Al filament has tensile residual strain in the axial direction. The model representation of thermal contraction is shown in Fig. [8.](#page-6-13) In Fig. [8](#page-6-13) (a), the axial length of the wire is defined as L0, at the 550 ◦C when the wire was free of residual strain. The axial lengths of the Nb3Al filament and the matrix material at room temperature are L<sup>a</sup> and Lb, respectively, considering their thermal contraction separately as shown in Fig. [8](#page-6-13) (b) and (c). In actuality, the composite wire shrank to length L<sup>1</sup> with residual strains between the Nb3Al filament and the matrix material at room temperature, as shown in Fig. [8](#page-6-13) (d). The residual strains of Nb3Al filament and matrix materials in the axial direction were calculated as follows.

At room temperature, the stresses σ between the Nb3Al filament and the matrix material in axial direction are given as

$$\int\_{0}^{r\_a} \sigma\_a dr + \int\_{r\_a}^{r\_b} \sigma\_b dr = 0 \tag{1}$$

As σ = Eǫ,

$$\epsilon\_{\mathbf{a}} = \frac{L\_1 - L\_a}{L\_a}, and \tag{2}$$

$$
\epsilon\_{\rm b} = \frac{L\_1 - L\_b}{L\_b},
\tag{3}
$$

eq. (1) can be written

$$E\_\mathrm{a} f\_\mathrm{a} \frac{L\_1 - L\_a}{L\_a} = -E\_\mathrm{b} f\_\mathrm{b} \frac{L\_1 - L\_b}{L\_b},\tag{4}$$

where E is the Young's modulus, f is the volume fraction, and ǫ is the residual strain between the Nb3Al filament and the matrix material. The thermal strains ǫ ′ are expressed as

$$
\epsilon\_\mathbf{a}' = \int\_{T\_H}^{T\_R} (-C\_\mathbf{a}) dT = \frac{L\_\mathbf{a} - L\_0}{L\_0} \tag{5}
$$

$$
\epsilon\_\mathbf{b}' = \int\_{T\_H}^{T\_R} (-C\_\mathbf{b}) dT = \frac{L\_\mathbf{b} - L\_0}{L\_0}.\tag{6}
$$

From eqs. (2), (3), (5), and (6), the residual strains can be written as

$$\epsilon\_{\rm a} = \frac{L\_1}{L\_0(1 + \epsilon\_{\rm a}')} - 1\tag{7}$$

$$
\epsilon\_\mathrm{b} = \frac{L\_1}{L\_0(1 + \epsilon\_\mathrm{b}')} - 1.\tag{8}
$$

Then,

$$\frac{L\_1}{L\_0} = \frac{(E\_a f\_a + E\_b f\_b)(1 + \epsilon\_\mathbf{a}')(1 + \epsilon\_\mathbf{b}')}{E\_a f\_\mathbf{a} (1 + \epsilon\_\mathbf{b}') + E\_\mathbf{b} f\_\mathbf{b} (1 + \epsilon\_\mathbf{a}')} \tag{9}$$

from eqs. (4), (5), and (6).

Eqs. (7), (8), and (9) show that the residual strains are

$$
\epsilon\_{\rm a} = \frac{(E\_a f\_a + E\_b f\_b)(1 + \epsilon\_{\rm b}')}{E\_a f\_{\rm a} (1 + \epsilon\_{\rm b}') + E\_{\rm b} f\_{\rm b} (1 + \epsilon\_{\rm a}')} - 1
$$

$$
\epsilon\_{\rm b} = \frac{(E\_a f\_a + E\_b f\_b)(1 + \epsilon\_{\rm a}')}{E\_a f\_{\rm a} (1 + \epsilon\_{\rm b}') + E\_{\rm b} f\_{\rm b} (1 + \epsilon\_{\rm a}')} - 1.

The calculation parameters for Nb3Al, Ta, and Nb at room temperature are shown in Tables [1](#page-1-0) and [3.](#page-5-1)

The calculation results for residual strain are shown in Fig. [7.](#page-5-0) In sample C, the calculation results for Nb3Al filament and Ta, which was similar to result obtained by multi-peak analysis. In sample A, residual strain obtained by the model calculation was less than that obtained by the multi-peak analysis for the Nb3Al filament and the former was larger than the latter for the Ta. This indicates that the strain mechanism for the all-Ta matrix is different from that for the all-Nb matrix in axial direction. Considering the different strain mechanism of samples A and C in transverse direction, it may be related to effect from the transverse direction due to the high hardness of the Ta and the complicated structure of cross section.

constants a<sup>m</sup> for three types wires by multi-peak analysis having anisotropic lattice strains in axial and transverse directions of wire, due to the different diffraction elastic stiffness in lattice planes, and the sample configuration. The multi-peak analysis showed good accuracy in the estimation of residual strain in RHQ-Nb3Al wires. We have estimated the tensile residual strain of the Nb3Al filament and the compressive strain of the Ta and Nb in the axial direction, by analyzing the lattice constant a<sup>m</sup> . By comparing the all-Nb matrix and the composite matrix samples, the residual strains is greatly affected by the type of inter-filament material. We also obtained the difference in the residual strain of Nb3Al filament between the all-Ta matrix and all-Nb matrix samples in the RHQ-Nb3Al wires, and the residual strains were calculated by thermal strain model in axial direction. Result, the all-Ta matrix and the all-Nb matrix samples showed different strain mechanisms in the axial and transverse direction.

This study was conducted under the LHC high luminosity upgrade project.
