An analysis of experim ental heat capacity at T > To is presented for series of samples (R)Ba2Cu30 6+x (with x close to optimal). For all samples the anom aly was discovered which occurred steadily in the interval 250{290 K (anom aly Tn). The anom aly Tn looks like a phase transition anom aly. It was shown that the anom aly Th superconducting anom aly To temperatures Th and To being connected by the ratio The . The anom aly Th is interpreted as the origination of pairing the charge carriers. A nom alles at T 3T were also detected in heat capacity of low tem perature superconductors H g and N b3G e.

#### INTRODUCTION

At present the study of peculiarities in di erent properties of cuprate superconductors (HT SC 's) in a norm al state attracts a special attention. It results from a tendency for understanding a pseudogap phenomenon revealing itself as a lowering the electron density of states well above the superconducting tem perature To. The problem is discussed whether or not both the pseudogap and the superconductivity are the phenom ena of the sam e origin. It is believed that the solution is of fundam ental im portance for the clari cation of high tem perature superconductivity mechanism in cuprate system s. This explains a great num ber of works in the eld (see references in reviews [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]).

Now it is not clear if the pseudogap line is only crossover, Ref. [9], [10], or it is accom panied by the hidden change of order param eter sym m etry, R ef. [11], [12], [13], [14]. It seem s to be actual to investigate the heat capacity in order to clarify the question about the possible critical behavior of these objects in the tem perature region of norm al state.

In this work we present results of such investigation for series of 90 K sam ples (R )B a2C u30 6+ x (w here R m eans Y or G d, Tm , H o) w ith x close to the optim al value. M aking use of elaborated before technique for separating the heat capacity into di erent contributions, Ref. [15], we exam ine experim ental data in a w ide tem perature intervalofnorm alstate. An anom aly was discovered w hich occurs steadily in the range 250 (290 K (Tn anom aly). It w as noted that as T ã€‚ changes, Th also changes so that the relation Th 3T cakes place [16], [17]. Now we present additional evidences of such interrelation .

#### EXPERIM ENTAL

The experim ental heat capacity Co (T ) above Tc can be presented by the follow ing expression [18]:

$$\mathcal{C}\_{\mathsf{D}} \left( \mathsf{T} \right) = \mathcal{C}\_{\mathsf{h}\texttt{a}\texttt{r}\mathfrak{m}} \left( \mathsf{T} \right) + \quad \mathsf{T} + \mathsf{A} \left( \mathsf{T} \right) \quad \mathsf{T}\_{\mathsf{O}} \left( \right) \quad + \quad \mathsf{C} \left( \mathsf{T} \right) ;$$

The term Charm (T) describes a harmonic lattice part. The term T describes a linear electron part and a linear anham onic contribution . The term A (T To ) describes a possible nonlinear in T anham on ic contribution and a possible contribution of low tem perature w ing of anom aly resulted from ordering oxygen [18]. The rst three term s describe regular contributions to the heat capacity. The term C (T ) describes the possible localized anom alies. Subtracting the regular contributions from the experim ental heat capacity we obtain the com ponent C (T ) . Regular contributions are sm ooth and m onotone which can introduce no localized in tem perature peculiarities when subtracting. They were determ ined from the experim ental heat capacity as described in [15], [18].

**Caption:** Figure 1 illustrates the functions C(T)/T and d(C/T)/dT of the compound YBa2Cu3O6.95 on the interval of superconducting phase transition. The plot indicates the presence of a superconducting phase transition at T_c = 92 K and an additional anomaly at Th = 277 K, suspected to resemble a phase transition.

A s an exam ple, the data for Y B a2C u30 6:95 can be considered. The superconducting phase transition of this sam ple takes place at Tc 92 K (Fig. 1). An anom aly was observed at 277 K (anom aly Th , Fig. 2).

A nother exam ple w hich gives evidence to such a relationship between T<sup>c</sup> and T<sup>h</sup> is presented below for two sam ples T m Ba2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup> and G dBa2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup>. T hese sam pleshavebeen synthesized by identicalway,and m easurem ents of their heat capacity have been carried out in the sam e calorim eter w ith the sam e operating conditions. T he tem peratures of superconducting transitions di er distinctly from each other: T<sup>c</sup> = 91.2 K for T m Ba2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup> and T<sup>c</sup> = 94:5 K for G dBa2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup> (Fig.3).

**Caption:** Figure 3 depicts the function Cp/T over the superconducting phase transition interval for TmBa2Cu3O6.95 and GdBa2Cu3O6.95. Observations confirm distinct superconducting transition temperatures, Tc = 91.2 K for TmBa2Cu3O6.95 and Tc = 94.5 K for GdBa2Cu3O6.95, highlighting subtle differences in heat capacity responses.

If indeed the tem peratures T<sup>h</sup> and T<sup>c</sup> are related by

the ratio Th/T<sup>c</sup> 3, then a peak in heat capacity of T m Ba2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup> can be expected at T<sup>h</sup> 274 K and a peak in heat capacity G dBa2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup> can be expected at T<sup>h</sup> 284 K .To check this prediction the di erence Cdif oftheir m olar heat capacities has been derived in the range 150{300 K (Fig.4).

In the obtained di erence, all the errors sources of w hich are in the experim entaltechnique and sources of w hich arecaused by a presenceofpossibleo -controllable im purities are practically excluded. A s a background, only the sm ooth contribution from a Shottky anom aly in heatcapacity ofT m Ba2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup> and the characteristic spread rem ain in this di erence. It is seen in Fig.4 that indeed, on this background, there is a m axim um at 274 K corresponding to the expected peak T<sup>h</sup> for T m Ba2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup> and thereisa m inim um at 285 K ,corresponding to the expected peak T<sup>h</sup> forG dBa2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup>.

The graph shows a maximum at Th = 274 K for TmBa2Cu3O6.95 and a minimum at Th = 285 K for GdBa2Cu3O6.95, supporting the expected temperature relationships and further illustrating anomalies associated with their heat capacities.

From experim ents w ith the heat capacity oftwo sam ples H oBa2C u3O 6+ <sup>x</sup> we obtained one further exam ple supported the presence ofanom aly atT 3T<sup>c</sup> (anom aly Th). T he sam ple H oBa2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup> was prepared by the m ethod ofpow der-calcination.T hehigh purity reactants Ba(C O 3),H o2O 3 and C uO (99.99,99.9 and 99.99 % respectively)were m ixed in stoichiom etric proportionsand ground w ith an agate m ortarand a pestle. T he m ixture was two tim es heated at 1170 K for 12 h. T he sam ple was  nally sintered in oxygen atm osphere at 1230 K for 24 h, and then cooled dow n to 620 K .A fter annealing

at 620 K for 3 h in oxygen atm osphere,the sam ple was quenched rapidly to room tem perature.T heproductwas identi ed by X -ray pow derdi raction w hich provided no evidenceofextra phasesotherthan thephaseofintended orthorhom bic structure. T he oxygen content was determ ined by iodom etric titration as corresponding to the form ula H oBa2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup>.

T he heat capacity Cp(T) has been m easured in the range 8{300 K . T here was observed a characteristic of the sam ple: its superconducting anom aly was split into two peaks,w ith T<sup>c</sup> = 86 K and T<sup>c</sup> = 90 K .Forextracting the anom alouscom ponentfrom the heatcapacity Cp(T), the regular background has been subtracted. A s a regular background, the heat capacity of another sam ple H oBa2C u3O 6+ <sup>x</sup> w ith the oxygen index assum ed to be about6.5{6.6 wasused.T hissam ple wassynthesized by the identicalm ethod and di ered only by the annealing regim e.T hem easurem entofitsheatcapacity wascarried out in the sam e calorim eter and at the sam e conditions w ithin the sam e tem perature range.

**Caption:** Figure 5 displays anomalies in the heat capacity of the compound HoBa2Cu3O6.95 within the temperature range of 50â€“300 K. The superconducting anomalies split into two peaks, T_c1 = 86 K and T_c2 = 90 K, with an additional two-peak anomaly in the normal state region at T_h1 = 257 K and T_h2 = 269 K. These observations suggest a relation Th/Tc â‰ˆ 3, indicating a possible imprint of the superconducting phase transition onto other temperature regions .


FIG . 5: A nom alies in heat capacity of H oB a2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup> in the range 50{300 K .

It is obvious that the obtained di erence C (T) between heat capacities ofthe above com pounds contains the possible anom alies in Cp(T) ofH oBa2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup> and a sm all di erence between their regular electron and phonon com ponents. It is presented in Fig.5.

It should be noted that in addition to the split superconducting anom aly,there is the two peak anom aly in the norm alstate region (two peaks T<sup>h</sup> = 257 K and T<sup>h</sup> = 269 K ),the relation Th=T<sup>c</sup> being equal3 to a good accuracy for both peaks. It looks as though the superconducting phase transition isim aged into othertem peratureinterval.In Fig.6 thedi erenceC (T)ispresented on the interval200-300 K in a large scale.

In given exam ples the localized anom aly T<sup>h</sup> wasseparated using three di erent ways for subtracting the regular contributions from the experim entalheat capacity.

**Caption:** Figure 6 demonstrates the difference in molar heat capacities of two compounds, HoBa2Cu3O6+x, over the range 200-300 K, allowing comparison of the shapes of superconducting anomalies shifted by a factor of 3 in temperature. This visualization helps illustrate the hypothesis of systematic relationships between superconducting transition temperatures and higher temperature anomalies.

A s a rule,for di erent sam ples the am plitude ofthis anom aly variesfrom 0.4 to 3.6 J m ol<sup>1</sup> K <sup>1</sup> w hich is0.15{ 1.3 % oftotalheat capacity.In individualcasesthe am plitude ofanom aly T<sup>h</sup> iscom parable to the am plitude of anom aly Tc.T hespread ofexperim entalpointsin theinterval100{300K variesfrom 0.02% up to 0.1% depending on an am ountofa sam ple and on calorim eterand installation characteristicsfor concrete m easurem ents.

R esults ofheat capacity investigations point out that theshapeand theam plitudeofsuperconducting anom aly T<sup>c</sup> depend substantially on details of synthesis of90 K sam ples,R ef.[\[19\]](#page-5-0),[\[20](#page-5-0)]. W e believe that the shape and the am plitude ofanom aly T<sup>h</sup> also depend substantially on detailsofsynthesis.T herew ith itispossible thatthey di er even for the sam ples w ith the sam e x.

T he anom aly T<sup>h</sup> in heat capacity looks like a phase transition anom aly.Itsshape,in occasion,resem blesthe shape of superconducting anom aly Tc. T he above exam ples show that the higher is Tc,the higher is T<sup>h</sup> and

there exists the relationship between the values T<sup>h</sup> and Tc: T<sup>h</sup> 3Tc. T he anom aly T<sup>c</sup> is as though m apped onto other tem perature intervalin form ofanom aly Th. T his correlation between tem peraturesT<sup>h</sup> and T<sup>c</sup> points to a relationship between the T<sup>h</sup> process and the superconductivity. W e have called such correlation the "tem perature echo".

From the above correlation between the anom aliesT<sup>h</sup> and T<sup>c</sup> it m ight be concluded that T<sup>h</sup> process like the T<sup>c</sup> processisconnected w ith the changesin electron subsystem and re
ects the onset ofsuperconductivity. T he change of electron density of states N (E<sup>F</sup> ) resulted from T<sup>h</sup> - anom aly can be estim ated by relationship = S=T<sup>h</sup> (N (E<sup>F</sup> ) is proportionalto ,here is thecoe cientofelectron heatcapacity, S istheentropy ofanom aly Th). T he estim ation for H oBa2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup> exhibiting ratherhigh anom aly T<sup>h</sup> am ong the seriesofour investigated com pounds show s that is less than 5% of . Such change is di cult to detect directly w hich m ightexplain w hy there are no evidencesofanom aly T<sup>h</sup> in literature.

**Caption:** Figure 7 illustrates the coefficient of thermal expansion (Î±) as a function of temperature for a single crystal YBa2Cu3O6.95 along three orthorhombic axes: a-axis, b-axis, and c-axis. Measurements reveal an anomaly at approximately the glass transition temperature T_g = 290 K, correlating with the superconducting transition temperature T_c. This Figure supports the hypothesis of a systematic link between anomalies at T_g and T_c across various measurements, underlined by the consistent ratio of 3 (T_g = 3T_c). This finding suggests a fundamental link potentially driven by strong electron-phonon coupling, which alters lattice dynamics in superconductors (R)Ba2Cu3O6+x.


FIG .7: T he coe cient oftherm alexpansion (T)along the three orthorhom bic axes for the single crystalY B a2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup> (Figure from article P.N agelet. al.,R ef.[\[22](#page-5-0)]).

T he occurrence of som e process at T 3T<sup>c</sup> is supported by the anom alies in som e other properties of superconductors (R )Ba2C u3O 6+ <sup>x</sup> (see for exam ple R ef.[\[21\]](#page-5-0),[\[22\]](#page-5-0)). In the work [\[21\]](#page-5-0)the step-like anom aly of ultrasound velocity in superconductorsG dBaSrC u3O <sup>7</sup> <sup>x</sup> (T<sup>c</sup> = 82 K ) was noted around tem perature T<sup>g</sup> = 245 K indicating a pronounced lattice hardening (note that T<sup>g</sup> 3T<sup>c</sup> !). In the work [\[22](#page-5-0)]the coe cient oftherm al expansion (T) along the three orthorhom bic axes was m easured forthesinglecrystalY Ba2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>95</sup>.A long the axesa and btheanom aly atT<sup>c</sup> wasobserved and also the

anom aly at the tem perature T<sup>g</sup> = 290 K was observed, Fig.7. N ote thatT<sup>g</sup> 3T<sup>c</sup> ! T hese results indicate that in a lattice subsystem the sam e relationship between the tem peraturesT<sup>g</sup> and T<sup>c</sup> occurs.

Taking into accountthe strong electron -phonon coupling in (R )Ba2C u3O 6+ <sup>x</sup> superconductors (see R ef.[\[4\]](#page-5-0), [\[5\]](#page-5-0), [\[6](#page-5-0)], [\[7\]](#page-5-0)) one can expect that at any change of electron characteristics, the phonon characteristics inevitably change. T hus it looks like the anom alies at T<sup>g</sup> in lattice subsystem and the anom aly at T<sup>h</sup> in electron subsystem are ofthe sam e nature.

T he peculiarities of di erent properties observed in tem perature intervalabove T<sup>c</sup> are ordinarily put dow n to the pseudogap phenom ena,see review s[\[1\]](#page-5-0),[\[2\]](#page-5-0),[\[3](#page-5-0)],[\[5\]](#page-5-0), [\[7\]](#page-5-0). T his pseudogap <sup>d</sup> (doped) is the reduced density ofstatesintrinsic to the energy band structure ofH T SC s and revealing itselfaspeculiaritiesofsom ephysicalpropertiesin vicinity oftem peratureT in underdoped range. N ow the corresponding line on the phase diagram T (x) iswellknow n [\[1\]](#page-5-0),[\[2](#page-5-0)],[\[3](#page-5-0)],[\[5\]](#page-5-0),[\[8\]](#page-5-0):the valuesT arelowering w hen x is grow ing. T he results ofnum erous studies show that crossing this line results in som ething other than phase transition and is unrelated to superconductivity [\[5\]](#page-5-0),[\[7](#page-5-0)].

T he coexistence oftwo phenom ena in electron subsystem at T<sup>h</sup> and T<sup>c</sup> leads us to the follow ing assum ption. IfT<sup>c</sup> isthe tem perature oforigin ofsuperconducting gap

<sup>c</sup>, then T<sup>h</sup> can be identi ed w ith the tem perature of origin of another pseudogap <sup>p</sup> (pairing) and the Thprocess can be identi ed w ith the pairing ofcharge carriers w hich results in suppression of spectral weight in the quasiparticle spectrum . T his process m eans the onset of superconductivity. O n the phase diagram it w ill be presented by the line T<sup>h</sup> 3Tc(x).

So, one can concede that there exist two di erent pseudogaps in the density of states of superconductors (R )Ba2C u3O 6+ <sup>x</sup>. O ne is the pseudogap <sup>p</sup> connected w ith the onsetofsuperconductivity and revealed itselfin heat capacity as a phase transition at tem perature m ultiple ofTc. A nother pseudogap,wellknow n one,is the pseudogap <sup>d</sup>,appeared in di erentpropertiesofH T SC s in vicinity ofline T (x) as som ething other than phase transition.

T hediscovered phenom enon (tem peratureecho)m ight representthe therm odynam ic evidence ofthe origination ofsuperconducting pseudogap <sup>p</sup> at tem perature T<sup>h</sup> 3Tc(x).

Ifthe cuprate superconductors w ith the strong electron-phonon coupling exhibit the anom aly T<sup>h</sup> in heat capacity (tem perature echo ofsuperconducting phase transition) then one can expect that the low tem perature superconductors w ith strong electron -phonon coupling

**Caption:** Figure 10 shows the electronic heat capacity (T + C) of the Nb3Ge compound, indicating a superconducting anomaly at 6 K, and another anomaly at a temperature approximately 3T_c (18 K). This highlights a potential intrinsic phenomenon of superconductors related to strong electron-phonon coupling.
