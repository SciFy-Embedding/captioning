**Abstract.** The high frequency vortex motion in Nb3Sn was analyzed in this work up to 12 T. We used a dielectric loaded resonator tuned at 15 GHz to evaluate the surface impedance Z of a Nb3Sn bulk sample (24.8 at.%Sn). From the field induced variation of Z, the high frequency vortex parameters (the pinning constant kp, the depinning frequency ν<sup>p</sup> and the flux flow resistivity ρf f ) were obtained over a large temperature and field range; their field and temperature dependences were analyzed. Comparison with other superconducting materials shows that high frequency applications in strong magnetic fields are also feasible with Nb3Sn. In the present work, we report the first measurements about the microwave response in Nb3Sn in strong magnetic fields.

# **1. Introduction**

Among superconducting (SC) materials, Nb3Sn is currently one of the most used in technological applications due to its interesting superconductive and mechanical properties. Despite being a well-known material, new perspective applications of Nb3Sn, such as superconductive radio frequency cavities (SRFC) [\[1,](#page-20-0) [2\]](#page-20-1) also for magnetic environments [\[3–](#page-20-2)[6\]](#page-20-3) and improved magnets for new particles accelerators (e.g. the High Luminosity upgrade of LHC, or the Future Circular Collider FCC [\[7,](#page-20-4) [8\]](#page-20-5)), are revamping the interest in Nb3Sn characterization [\[9](#page-20-6)[–11\]](#page-20-7). In fact, it is necessary to test this SC in the new challenging working conditions of these applications, to better understand how to improve its performances.

In particular, the interest in Nb3Sn is increasing, the goal being to improve the high frequency performances in view of its use in SRFC particle accelerators. At present, the most used material for this application field is elementary Nb. However, the need to improve the performances of RF cavities and to achieve higher accelerating fields motivated the search for a new material. Nb3Sn is a good candidate for this application but there is still a need to study why the predicted performances (i.e. superheating field) are still far from those experimentally obtained [\[12](#page-20-8)[–16\]](#page-20-9). Local geometrical surface defects are often identified as being responsible for these low performances. A recent theoretical study has identified in the broadening of the density of states, in regions with higher pair-breaking scattering rates, a source of local heating and thus of decrease of the superheating field [\[17\]](#page-20-10).

As reported above, different kinds of RF-cavities are expected to work in presence of moderate to high static magnetic fields. It its well known that superconductors, at high frequencies and in the presence of magnetic fields, can exhibit surface resistances comparable to those of normal conductors. In fact, under these conditions the main dissipative phenomenon is related to the vortex oscillations induced by the impinging electromagnetic (e.m.) wave. For these applications, materials are searched with properties being quite different from those needed for the realization of standard SRFC cavities. Indeed, cavities optimized for zero static magnetic field require a pure superconductor with ideally no pinning centers to completely remove the trapped field after cooldown. However, in finite static magnetic fields, strong pinning is needed to avoid large oscillations of the fluxons. In particular, above the so called depinning frequency ν<sup>p</sup> the vortices move in the highly dissipative flux-flow regime [\[18–](#page-21-0)[20\]](#page-21-1). Hence, the measurement of ν<sup>p</sup> in high magnetic fields is a discriminating parameter for the application of SC materials in experiments in dc magnetic fields.

In many power applications of Nb3Sn, the knowledge of vortex pinning is essential. Even if microwave (µw) measurements do not directly yield design parameters for dc applications, they provide useful information about the pinning characteristics, in addition to those obtained by the dc characterization techniques. A better comprehension of the pinning phenomenon is only obtained by merging the different information given by different dynamical regimes [\[21\]](#page-21-2) and µw can help to unveil new vortex pinning regimes [\[22\]](#page-21-3).

Many aspects of the physics of Nb3Sn have been already studied. For what concerns the high frequency regime, Nb3Sn surface impedance Z measurements were performed in the 1-10 GHz range and allowed to observe deviations of the measured Z from the BCS theory and a particularly large gap ∆0/kBT = 2.15 (being k<sup>B</sup> and T the Boltzman constant and the temperature, respectively) [\[23–](#page-21-4)[25\]](#page-21-5). The higher frequency behavior (at 87 GHz) was explored in [\[26\]](#page-21-6) confirming the large superconductive gap in Nb3Sn, 1.8 < ∆0/kBT < 2.2. Despite the large ∆0, caused by a strong electron-phonon coupling in Nb3Sn, a typical BCS signature on the conductivity temperature dependence (e.g. a large coherence peak in the real part [\[27\]](#page-21-7)) was observed at 87 GHz [\[26,](#page-21-6) [28\]](#page-21-8). Since the experimentally determined penetration depth λ was shown to be close to the expected BCS value λBCS [\[29\]](#page-21-9), the latter is often used when analyzing the experimental Nb3Sn data [\[29\]](#page-21-9). The first Z measurements in Nb3Sn at low magnetic fields (not larger than 12 mT) and in the non-linear region were presented in [\[30\]](#page-21-10).

As it can be seen from the present description of the high frequency behavior of Nb3Sn, no studies exist on the high frequency vortex motion regime in high static magnetic field. We present in this work a complete microwave (∼ 15 GHz) characterization of Nb3Sn up to 12 T (with preliminary results reported in [\[31\]](#page-21-11)) to provide new useful information about high frequency vortex motion physics in this SC. Thus, this work fills the gap of knowledge in the high frequency behavior of Nb3Sn in high magnetic fields. In particular, the surface impedance Z(T, H) of a bulk Nb3Sn polycristalline sample is here measured with a dielectric loaded resonator (DR) [\[32\]](#page-21-12) in zero field cooling (ZFC) condition at fixed temperature T, and in field cooling (FC) condition at fixed applied magnetic field µ0H values up to 12 T. Then, with a classical electrodynamics approach the complex resistivity ρ˜(T, H) is obtained and analyzed with the Coffey–Clem model [\[33\]](#page-21-13) in order to obtain the complex vortex motion resistivity ρ˜vm(T, H) of Nb3Sn. Assuming negligible thermal phenomena, ρ˜vm is only a function of the real flux flow resistivity ρf f , the depinning frequency ν<sup>p</sup> and the measurement frequency ν<sup>0</sup> [\[18\]](#page-21-0). Thus, ρf f and ν<sup>p</sup> are obtained resorting to literature values of the London penetration depth, which is a well known quantity in Nb3Sn [\[23,](#page-21-4) [34,](#page-21-14) [35\]](#page-21-15). The measured ν<sup>p</sup> of bulk Nb3Sn is remarkably high when compared with ν<sup>p</sup> in thin Nb films.

The measured ρf f is shown to exhibit a conventional Bardeen–Stephen behavior [\[36\]](#page-21-16). The scaling of the ρf f with the applied magnetic field allowed us to evaluate the upper critical field Hc2(T) down to 4 K. The so obtained Hc2(T) is well fitted by the Maki-de Gennes approximation [\[37,](#page-21-17) [38\]](#page-21-18), as expected from other works [\[39\]](#page-21-19).

Following [\[40\]](#page-21-20) we extended the analysis of the high frequency vortex pinning characteristics in Nb3Sn considering the contribution of the thermal creep: based on analytical constraints of the used equations and physical limits, a statistical approach is used to assess probability intervals of the evaluated pinning parameters.

The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. [2](#page-2-0) the high frequency vortex motion is briefly described, in Sec. [3](#page-3-0) the measurement method is presented, then the sample characteristics are reported in Sec. [4.](#page-5-0) Finally the results are presented in Sec. [5](#page-5-1) and in Sec. [6](#page-17-0) a comparison of the µw performances of Nb3Sn with those of MgB<sup>2</sup> and YBa2Cu3O7-<sup>δ</sup> is performed.

# <span id="page-2-0"></span>**2. Surface impedance of superconductors in the mixed state**

The surface impedance Z is the complex physical quantity commonly used to describe the electromagnetic (e.m.) response of good conductors [\[41\]](#page-21-21). It is defined as the ratio Z = Ek/H<sup>k</sup> [\[42\]](#page-21-22), where E<sup>k</sup> and H<sup>k</sup> are respectively the electric and magnetic fields components parallel to the surface of the conductor. Z contains interesting information about the dissipative and energy storing effects of the material under study. For bulk materials, in the local limit, Z = √ iωµ0ρ˜ [\[42\]](#page-21-22), where ω = 2πν is the angular frequency of the impinging e.m. wave, µ<sup>0</sup> is the vacuum magnetic permeability and ρ˜ is the complex resistivity of the material. Since in this work we deal with a Nb3Sn superconductive bulk sample in high magnetic field, ρ˜ contains both the super/normal fluid complex charge transport contributions and the vortex flow characteristics as presented in [\[33\]](#page-21-13). The first contribution is modeled by the two-fluid conductivity σ2<sup>f</sup> = σ<sup>1</sup> − iσ<sup>2</sup> and the second by the complex vortex motion resistivity ρvm, thus ρ˜ = f (σ2<sup>f</sup> , ρvm). Far enough from the superconductive transition, where σ<sup>2</sup> σ1, the normal fluid screening effect is weak enough to be neglected and Z is written as:

<span id="page-2-1"></span>
$$Z \simeq \sqrt{\omega \mu\_0 \left( -\frac{1}{\sigma\_2} + \mathrm{i}\,\rho\_{vm} \right)};\tag{1}$$

where σ<sup>2</sup> = 1/ωµ0λ 2 , with λ the London penetration depth. When no external magnetic field is applied ρvm = 0 and Z ' q −ωµ0/σ<sup>2</sup> = iωµ0λ.

With high frequencies (microwaves) excitation and low e.m. field amplitude the vortices start oscillating around their equilibrium positions (the pinning centres) as damped harmonic oscillators and their dissipative and reactive response depends on the pinning potential characteristics. Within the harmonic oscillator formalism, we can describe the Lorentz force due to the interaction between the microwave induced currents Jµw and the magnetic flux quanta Φ<sup>0</sup> as the driving force, the pinning effect as a linear elastic force F<sup>p</sup> = −kpx (small oscillation), the non-equilibrium conversion between quasi-particles and condensate during the fluxons motion as a dissipative viscous drag force Fdrag = −ηv and finally the thermal creep as a stochastic thermal force Fth [\[18](#page-21-0)[–20,](#page-21-1)[27,](#page-21-7)[33,](#page-21-13)[40\]](#page-21-20). Thus, assuming massless fluxons [\[43\]](#page-21-23) the dynamic equation of motion becomes:

$$\mathbf{J}\_{\mu w} \times \Phi\_0 + \mathbf{F}\_{th} = k\_p \mathbf{z} + \eta \mathbf{v} \,, \tag{2}$$

with k<sup>p</sup> the pinning constant, x the fluxon displacement, η the viscous drag coefficient and v the fluxon velocity. The Coffey-Clem (CC) vortex motion resistivity ρvm is then obtained [\[33,](#page-21-13)[40\]](#page-21-20):

$$
\rho\_{vm} = \rho\_{ff} \frac{\epsilon + \mathbf{i}\nu/\nu\_c}{1 + \mathbf{i}\nu/\nu\_c},
\tag{3}
$$

where ρf f = Φ0B/η is the flux-flow resistivity, B the magnetic flux density. In the London limit B ' µ0H, with H the applied magnetic field strength. The thermal creep contribution is taken into account by the adimensional creep factor 0 ≤ ≤ 1 [\[33,](#page-21-13) [40\]](#page-21-20). ν<sup>c</sup> is the characteristic frequency of the vortex motion, marking the crossover between an elastic vortex motion regime (ν νc) and an highly dissipative regime (ν νc). When → 0, no flux creep exists and ν<sup>c</sup> → ν<sup>p</sup> with ν<sup>p</sup> the depinning frequency, defined as ν<sup>p</sup> = kp/(2πη). In the case of small oscillations here relevant, k<sup>p</sup> is the pinning linear elastic constant which for rigid fluxons is a measure of the pinning well steepness [\[40,](#page-21-20) [44\]](#page-21-24). The → 0 limit is known in literature as the Gittleman-Rosenblum (GR) model [\[18\]](#page-21-0):

$$
\rho\_{vm,GR} = \frac{\Phi\_0 B}{\eta} \frac{1}{1 - \mathbf{i}\frac{\nu\_p}{\nu}} \,. \tag{4}
$$

In the high creep limit → 1 the fluxons behave as free fluxons due to thermal jumps and a free-flux flow regime takes place. The (U0) and νc(νp, U0) dependences on the creep activation energy U<sup>0</sup> depend on the pinning potential shape and thus on the particular model used to describe the pinning profile [\[33,](#page-21-13) [45\]](#page-21-25).

Microwave measurements are particularly versatile since they allow to obtain a measure of both the pinning shape/steepness k<sup>p</sup> and of the free flux-flow resistivity ρf f which, particularly for bulk samples as in this case, would require high dc-current to be properly measured. In the following we describe how we obtain the vortex motion parameters in Nb3Sn bulks.

# <span id="page-3-0"></span>**3. Measurement system and method**

In this section we briefly outline how Z is obtained with our measuring system based on a dielectric loaded resonator (DR). Further information about the measurement technique with an in-depth uncertainties analysis is reported in [\[32\]](#page-21-12).

DRs are a measurement standard for superconductors Z characterization (IEC 61788- 7:2020) [\[46\]](#page-21-26) thanks to their high sensitivity. In the IEC standard twin SC samples are used and both resonator bases are covered by a SC sample. As shown in [\[32\]](#page-21-12) the double sample configuration is not always the right choice for the high field measurements, because of a lack of sensitivity in presence of high dissipations. For this reason, in this case, the single sample configuration (see Figure [1\)](#page-4-0) provides better performances [\[32\]](#page-21-12). Our set-up is composed by a copper cylindrical cavity loaded with a sapphire crystal as represented in Figure [1.](#page-4-0) The choice of the metallic enclosure is forced by the need to perform measurements in high magnetic fields: the use of a SC cavity would add a magnetic background of difficult evaluation. The used dielectric is a single-crystal sapphire cylinder (<sup>h</sup> = 5.<sup>00</sup> mm, = 8.<sup>00</sup> mm). The relatively high dielectric permittivity (ε<sup>k</sup> ∼ 11.5, ε<sup>⊥</sup> ∼ 9.5) and the low losses of sapphire are used to increase the measurement sensitivity by reducing the conduction losses on the lateral wall of the resonator [\[32\]](#page-21-12).

**Caption:** Figure 3: Schematic illustration of the experimental setup for inductive measurements of superconducting samples using a dielectric resonator method. The setup includes coax cables for signal input and output, a sapphire single-crystal resonator for hosting the superconducting sample, and a mask to ensure homogeneity in field application. This method is essential for high-precision studies of superconducting properties under varying electromagnetic fields and is instrumental in delivering reliable data for characterizing superconducting states【8:9†temp_paper_434d268cc7cd9f50a370c3e5d7127545.txt】.


Figure 1: Sketch of the dielectric loaded resonator.

An Anritsu Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) 37269D, is used to measure the four complex scattering parameters of the DR. The VNA and the DR are linked through a cryogenic and nonmagnetic K-type coaxial transmission line. The resonator is excited in the TE<sup>011</sup> resonating mode at ∼ 15 GHz, and it is characterized in transmission. The acquired scattering parameters are then fitted with a modified Fano resonance curve [\[47,](#page-21-27) [48\]](#page-21-28) which is used to obtain the unloaded quality factor Q and the resonance frequency ν<sup>0</sup> of the resonator. Measurements are performed at low µw power levels, the peak RF magnetic field impinging on the surface of the sample is estimated to be < 10 µT, to characterize Z in the linear regime. We did not observe any power dependence of the response in the range of temperature, fields and power level here explored.

The sample under study is loaded into the cavity in order to substitute a base of the resonator (end-wall perturbation method) and covered with a planar metallic mask, with a central circular hole ( <sup>∼</sup> <sup>6</sup> mm), to preserve the cylindrical geometry.

When an external magnetic field H is applied at a temperature T 0 the variation ∆Z(T 0 , H) = Z(T 0 , H) − Z(T 0 , 0) of Z is obtained as follows :

<span id="page-4-1"></span>
$$
\Delta Z(T',H) = G\_s \Delta \frac{1}{Q(T',H)} - 2\mathrm{i}G\_s \frac{\Delta \nu\_0(T',H)}{\nu\_{ref}} - \Delta bckg(T',H);\tag{5}
$$

where G<sup>s</sup> ≈ 2700 Ω is a geometrical factor evaluated with electromagnetic simulations and

∆x(T 0 , H) indicates a variation of x(T 0 , H) parameter with respect to the reference value obtained with no applied magnetic field x(T 0 , 0). νref is the reference resonance frequency at H = 0 T. Finally, bckg is a complex parameter which represents the response of the resonator itself. Since both the DR and the measurement system were carefully designed to operate in high magnetic fields, bckg is very weakly field dependent [\[32\]](#page-21-12), with respect to the SC sample variation ∆Z(T 0 , H), thus we assume ∆bckg(T 0 , H) ∼ 0 [†](#page-0-0).

Field cooling (FC) and zero field cooling (ZFC) measurements were performed and they are discussed in the next Section. In FC condition the magnetic field was applied before cooling. After cooling down to ∼ 6 K, the temperature was raised at a constant rate 0.1 K/min. In ZFC the sample was cooled without an externally applied magnetic field; when the target temperature was reached and stabilized within ±0.05 K, the magnetic field was swept at 0.3 T/min up to 12 T then down to -12 T and back to 0 T and the reversible component isolated.

# <span id="page-5-0"></span>**4. The sample**

The Nb3Sn sample platelet was obtained starting from a polycrystalline bulk piece sintered by Hot Isostatic Pressure (HIP) technique (2 kbar Argon pressure at 1250 ◦C for 24h) at the University of Geneva [\[49\]](#page-21-29). After HIP, the Nb3Sn bulk piece was cut into tiny platelets by means of spark erosion and each platelet was then polished with SiC grinding papers and submitted to "flash-anneal" heat treatment (900 ◦C/10 min) for stress release.

Microstructural and magnetization analyses reveal an average grain size of ∼ 20 µm, a composition very close to stoichiometry (24.8 at.%Sn) and a sharp superconducting transition at 17.9 K reflecting the high quality and homogeneity of these samples. Finally, from Rietveld refinement the lattice constant and the Bragg-Williams long-range order parameter have been estimated to be 5.291 Å and 0.98 respectively. Further details on the procedure and analysis can be found in [\[50\]](#page-21-30). A sample of approximate area of 30 mm<sup>2</sup> was chosen for the present study.

# <span id="page-5-1"></span>**5. Results**

In this section we first show the Q and ν<sup>0</sup> measurements to check the calibration process through the comparison of the obtained normal state sample characteristics with literature values. Then, we derive the vortex parameters under the common assumption of negligible thermal creep (i.e. Gittleman-Rosenblum (GR) model [\[18\]](#page-21-0)): the use of the GR model is the standard analysis procedure [\[19,](#page-21-31) [20,](#page-21-1) [44,](#page-21-24) [51\]](#page-21-32) so that it allows to easily compare the results on Nb3Sn with other materials. Finally, in the last subsection, the contribution given by the flux creep is evaluated with a statistical analysis of the obtained data.

†The weak magnetic contribution of the copper resonator was evaluated up to 12 T in the homogeneous configuration (without any SC sample loaded) to be: ∆ν<sup>0</sup> < 2.5 kHz T-1 and ∆Q < 40 T -1 with ν<sup>0</sup> ∼ 15 GHz and Q ∼ 17900.

# *5.1. Normal state*

In Figure [2](#page-7-0) we show the measured variation ∆(1/Q) = Q(T, H) <sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> − Q(T → 0, H = 0)<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> and ∆ν0/νref = (ν0(T, H) − νref )/νref with νref = ν0(T = Tc) at µ0H<sup>a</sup> = {0, 2, 4, 8, 12}T in FC condition. Since below ∼ 20 K the copper and sapphire losses do not depend on the temperature the height of the Q<sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> transition (Figure [2a\)](#page-7-0) can be assigned to ∆R of Nb3Sn. Thus, from Eq. [\(5\)](#page-4-1) R<sup>n</sup> = 94.6 mΩ with R<sup>n</sup> the normal state surface resistance. From Rn, the normal state resistivity is obtained from the normal skin effect as ρ<sup>n</sup> = 2R<sup>2</sup> n /ωµ<sup>0</sup> = 14.8 µΩcm.

An estimation of ρ<sup>n</sup> based on the long range order parameter S, yields ρ<sup>n</sup> = 147(1 − S 4 ) µΩcm [\[52\]](#page-21-33). The measured ρ<sup>n</sup> corresponds to S = 0.97, perfectly in agreement with the measurement obtained with X-ray diffractometry on a sample from the same batch of our platelet [\[49\]](#page-21-29).

Moreover, the obtained ρ<sup>n</sup> matches well also with the atomic Sn content β of the sample, since with ρ<sup>n</sup> = 14.8 µΩcm and from [\[53\]](#page-22-0), β = 0.25 to be compared to our data β = 0.248. This excellent agreement between the measured ρ<sup>n</sup> and the microscopic parameters measured on the sample from the same batch as ours represents a validation of the G<sup>s</sup> estimation. Moreover, the composition of the bulk sample is also in agreement with the measured T<sup>c</sup> and the generally accepted Tc(β) relation presented in [\[54\]](#page-22-1). This confirms that the Devantay data set is more descriptive of Nb3Sn bulk samples behavior than Moore's [\[55\]](#page-22-2) as discussed in [\[53\]](#page-22-0).

# *5.2. Microwave vortex motion in Nb3Sn*

In order to isolate the fluxon motion response of Nb3Sn, Eq. [\(5\)](#page-4-1) is applied to the data shown in Figure [2.](#page-7-0) In this way the temperature background contribution, which is particularly evident in ν<sup>0</sup> measurements (Figures [2b\)](#page-7-0), is removed. The same procedure is followed for the ZFC measurements shown in Figure [3.](#page-8-0) In this case the variations of Q and ν<sup>0</sup> are directly related to the sample ∆Z since the resonator is made only with non magnetic materials. Then, the vortex motion resistivity ρvm = ρ 0 vm + iρ 00 vm is obtained from the measured ∆Z, using Eq. [\(1\)](#page-2-1), as:

<span id="page-6-0"></span>
$$
\rho\_{vm}'(T,H) = 2\Delta R(T,H)\left(\lambda(T,0) + \frac{\Delta X(T,H)}{\mu\_0 \omega}\right) \,, \tag{6}
$$

<span id="page-6-1"></span>
$$\rho''\_{vm}(T,H) = \frac{-\Delta R(T,H)^2 + \left(\Delta X(T,H) + \lambda(T,0)\mu\_0\omega\right)^2}{\mu\_0\omega} - \mu\omega\lambda(T,H)^2. \text{(7)}$$

In order to reliably obtain ρvm, we calculate λ from the well known values, as follows. It is known [\[29\]](#page-21-9) that λ in Nb3Sn closely follows a BCS behavior [\[27\]](#page-21-7) although stoichiometric Nb3Sn exhibits similarities to strong coupling superconductors. It is then safe, following the common habit, to describe λ with the BCS expression in Eq.s [\(6\)](#page-6-0), [\(7\)](#page-6-1), with Debye temperature Θ<sup>D</sup> = 230 K [\[56\]](#page-22-3) and superconducting energy gap 2∆ = 3.77kBT<sup>c</sup> [\[57\]](#page-22-4). Finally, it must be noticed that at high fluxons densities (in practice, just above the first penetration field), and in our measurement frequency band, the main reactive contribution is given by the vortex motion, thus Eq.s [\(6\)](#page-6-0), [\(7\)](#page-6-1) are very weakly sensitive to λ. This was tested using as an alternative a simple two-fluid λ(T) temperature dependence 1 − t 2 and the discrepancies in the following

**Caption:** Figure 1: This figure presents the deviation of 1/Q and the reference-normalized frequency variation (Δν0/νref) against temperature (T) under several external magnetic fields (0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 T) during field cooling conditions. Panel (a) shows Δ(1/Q), representing the inverse quality factor changes, indicating damping losses in the resonator system. As the temperature increases, losses become more pronounced, indicating a rise in resistive losses at higher temperatures and fields. Panel (b) illustrates Δν0/νref, where ν0(T, H) denotes the resonant frequency at temperature T and field H, and νref represents the resonant frequency at the critical temperature (Tc). Changes in frequency reflect dynamic adjustments within the superconducting state as affected by temperature and magnetic field. These data reveal critical transitions and energy dissipation behaviors that are essential for understanding vortex dynamics in superconductors, providing insights into interactions at varying field strengths .

(b) Variation ∆ν0/νref = (ν0(T, H) − νref )/νref with νref = ν0(T = Tc) measured in field cooling condition at different fields (i.e. 0 T, 2 T, 4 T, 8 T, 12 T). The temperature background of the resonator, which gives rise to the ν<sup>0</sup> hump, is evident requiring the calibration procedure described in the text.

**Caption:** Figure 9: The surface impedance variation ΔZ at different temperatures (4 K, 6 K, 10 K, 15 K) under zero-field-cooled (ZFC) conditions is presented. The top panel (a) focuses on surface resistance (ΔR), while the bottom panel (b) addresses surface reactance (ΔX). The knee observable in the 15 K curve marks the onset of superconducting phase transition beyond μ0H > Hc². A smoother transition is noted in ΔX. These measurements are critical for characterizing superconducting performance under dynamic electromagnetic fields, especially in terms of defining phase transitions and assessing temperature-dependent impedance variations .

In (a) the surface resistance ∆R and in (b) the surface reactance ∆X. The knee in the 15 K ∆R curve corresponds to the superconductive phase transition: above that point the applied magnetic field µ0H > Hc<sup>2</sup> and ∆R is almost flat as expected in the normal state. On ∆X the transition is smoother thus less evident.

analysis were well below 5 %. For the field dependence we used a 1 − b 4 superfluid fraction dependence with b = B/Bc<sup>2</sup> the reduced field. Similarly to the T dependence, also the exact field dependence does not give significant changes on the final results.

From ρvm, with Eq. [\(3\)](#page-3-0), ρf f (T, H) and νp(T, H) are directly obtained within the Gittleman–Rosenblum (GR) model. As previously discussed, the GR model assumes negligible thermal effects, thus it is more descriptive of the data far from the critical surface. Nevertheless, when thermal creep is not negligible, the GR model provides a lower boundary for ν<sup>p</sup> and k<sup>p</sup> [\[40\]](#page-21-0). Thus, despite the model simplicity, the GR model is particularly useful for an estimation of the pinning parameters, as presented in the next subsections.

**Caption:** Figure 5: The figure presents the flux flow resistivity (ρff) of bulk Nb3Sn as a function of applied magnetic field (μ0H) at various temperatures (4 K, 6 K, 10 K) under zero-field-cooled (ZFC) conditions. The data exhibits a direct proportionality between ρff and H, a behavior typical of the Tinkham and Bardeen-Stephen vortex dissipation models, with field-independent viscosity. This relationship signifies increasing dissipation with temperature and field, critical for benchmarking the viscous drag in superconducting applications, particularly for radio frequency systems where energy dissipation must be minimized .

15 K ZFC curve is not analyzed here since near the transition the unavoidable presence of flux creep prevents from performing the analysis here presented. For the same reason the derivation of the vortex parameters is estimated as possible only for T < 0.8 Tc<sup>2</sup> where Tc<sup>2</sup> = Tc(H). Figure [4](#page-9-0) correctly shows that ρf f increases when T and H increase. This is an expected behaviour since ρf f ∝< τ ><sup>−</sup><sup>1</sup> with τ the quasiparticle scattering time in vortices core (which decreases approaching the superconductive transition [\[27\]](#page-21-1)) averaged on the Fermi surface. Moreover, Figure [4](#page-9-0) shows an almost perfect linear behavior ρf f ∝ H. This implies that η is field independent in agreement with both Tinkham [\[27\]](#page-21-1) and Bardeen-Stephen (BS) [\[36\]](#page-21-3) descriptions of the vortex dissipation phenomena. For T Tc, both theories give an equivalent description of the total viscosity [\[27,](#page-21-1) [36\]](#page-21-3):

**Caption:** Figure 2: Flux-flow resistivity (ρff) of Nb3Sn as a function of magnetic field normalized by the upper critical field (H/Hc2) across three temperatures (4 K, 6 K, and 10 K), scaled to the normal state resistivity (ρn). The results demonstrate a linear increase in ρff indicative of standard Bardeen-Stephen vortex motion behavior. The normalization ensures consistent unitary slope across different datasets, confirming the scalability and reliability of Hc2(T) estimation using these measurements and validating the utility of the Maki-de Gennes approximation for Nb3Sn【8:3†temp_paper_434d268cc7cd9f50a370c3e5d7127545.txt】.

which were directly observed, and/or obtained by the scaling procedure, are well fitted with the Maki-de Gennes (MG) approximation [\[37,](#page-21-4) [38\]](#page-21-5) (see Figure [6\)](#page-11-0) in agreement with the literature [\[39\]](#page-21-6). The fact that the Hc<sup>2</sup> points obtained by the scaling procedure are well placed on the MG curve further validates the use of the BS model for Nb3Sn and the scaling procedure. The MG model uses only two free parameters: T<sup>c</sup> (measured) and the normal electrons diffusion coefficient D. In particular, it can be shown [\[39\]](#page-21-6) that within the MG approximation µ0dHc2(T)/dT|<sup>T</sup>c= −4Φ0kB/π<sup>2</sup>hD¯ , with k<sup>B</sup> the Boltzmann constant and h¯ the reduced Planck constant. Thus, the fit contains only experimentally determined parameters. With the fit of the measured Hc2(T) we obtain D ∼ 5.0×10<sup>−</sup><sup>5</sup> m<sup>2</sup> /s. We point out that Hc2(T) does not depend on the electron-phonon coupling, thus even if the simple MG approximation does not take the coupling strength into account (differently from the more complex Eliashberg theory) it can be reliably used in this case: it is shown in literature [\[39\]](#page-21-6) that the MG model approximates well the Nb3Sn Hc2(T) behavior in different samples (e.g. single crystal, thin films, bulk, wires) and with different Sn contents [\[39\]](#page-21-6).

<span id="page-11-1"></span>*5.2.2. Pinning constant.* The pinning constant, shown in Figure [7,](#page-12-0) is obtained by combining Eq.s [\(6\)](#page-6-0) and [\(7\)](#page-6-1) and Eq. [\(4\)](#page-3-1), k<sup>p</sup> = 2πΦ0Bνp/ρf f . As presented in Sec. [2](#page-2-0) this parameter in the limiting case of rigid vortices is a measure of the steepness of the pinning potential wells. The obtained k<sup>p</sup> correctly decreases when the temperature and the magnetic field are increased due to a reduction of the pinning efficiency. Figure [7](#page-12-0) shows that even at µ0H = 8 T and T ∼ 8 K, k<sup>p</sup> > 10 kN/m<sup>2</sup> . This value indicates an enhanced pinning efficiency in Nb3Sn as compared to that of Nb films. In fact, in the latter, the k<sup>p</sup> literature value is assessed to be about an order of magnitude smaller than that of Nb3Sn at t = 0.5 in a 40 nm thick film [\[58\]](#page-22-0) and even smaller in a 30 nm thick film at t = 0.86 [\[59,](#page-22-1) [60\]](#page-22-2). A k<sup>p</sup> value similar similar to that of Nb3Sn was also observed on pristine bulk MgB2, where at 1 T and at 10 K k<sup>p</sup> ∼ 11 kN/m<sup>2</sup> [\[61\]](#page-22-3). Higher k<sup>p</sup> are observed in cuprates, e.g. k<sup>p</sup> ' 75 kN/m<sup>2</sup> at t = 0.5 and µ0H = 0.5 T in 100 nm YBa2Cu3O7-<sup>δ</sup> thin film added with BaZrO<sup>3</sup> inclusions [\[62\]](#page-22-4), and k<sup>p</sup> up to 100 kN/m<sup>2</sup> attained even at much higher t ∼ 0.74, at µ0H = 0.5 T, in 200 nm YBa2Cu3O7-<sup>δ</sup> thin film added with Ba2YNbO6+Ba2YTaO<sup>6</sup> inclusions [\[63,](#page-22-5) [64\]](#page-22-6).

The temperature dependence kp(T) is shown in Figure [7:](#page-12-0) k<sup>p</sup> decreases steadily with the temperature indicating that no matching-field effects take place. The temperatures for which k<sup>p</sup> = 0, corresponding to the complete vanishing of the pinning effect, are obtained through a linear extrapolation of the high temperature region of the curves in Figure [7.](#page-12-0) The corresponding points are reported on the phase diagram of Figure [6.](#page-11-0) These points mark the depinning line as obtained by the microwave technique. As it can be seen, the complete flattening of the pinning potential arises very close to Hc2.

Data points include blue circles from temperature sweeps and red squares from field sweeps, with additional data at 4 K, 6 K, and 10 K derived from flux flow resistivity scaling. The fitting of this data employs the Maki-de Gennes model, providing a theoretical framework matching the experimental observations.

**Caption:** Figure 8: This figure illustrates the pinning constant (kp) across different field and temperature configurations, focusing on field cooling (FC) and zero-field cooling (ZFC) conditions at μ0H = 2, 4, 8, 12 T. Inset reveals kp at 4 K, following a power-law (kp ∝ H^α) with α = -0.47, representative of a collective pinning regime. The behavior of kp as fields intensify illustrates interaction dynamics between vortices and pinning centers, crucial for determining the potential of Nb3Sn in applications requiring robust pinning under high-field, low-temperature conditions .


Figure 7: Measured pinning constant kp(H, T) in FC condition at 2 T, 4 T, 8 T, 12 T. The sparse empty cyrcles come from the ZFC measurements. In the inset kp(H) at 4 K is shown in a log-log plot to highlight the power dependence k<sup>p</sup> ∝ H<sup>α</sup> , with α = −0.47, typical of the collective pinning regime.

The ZFC measured kp(H) at 4 K is shown in the inset of Figure [7](#page-12-0) to follow the power law dependence k<sup>p</sup> ∝ H<sup>α</sup> with α = −0.47. This behavior is expected in the collective pinning regime where for conventional superconductors one expects α = −0.5 [\[18,](#page-21-7)[44,](#page-21-2)[65\]](#page-22-7). In fact, this field dependence indicates that, even at low temperature, vortices in Nb3Sn are not individually pinned but a bunch of vortices is bounded around weak pins, thus the vortices concentration is higher than that of the pinning centres. We indicate this pinning regime as *collective pinning* according to [\[44\]](#page-21-2). In this configuration the fluxons interact with each other, and thus the pinning properties are strongly dependent on the fluxons density and the pinning strength decreases with the field. In this regime k<sup>p</sup> is no more a direct measure of the single pinning centre strength but it is a statistical average of the contribution given by several pinning centres and vortices. This means that in principle there is still room of improvement for enhanced k<sup>p</sup> values in Nb3Sn samples engineered for high field and high frequency applications (e.g. RF cavities for dark matter research [\[4\]](#page-20-0)). In fact an upper limit for k<sup>p</sup> can be estimated in the single-vortex pinning regime by assuming vortices individually pinned by cylindrical defects of diameter 2ξ, being ξ the coherence length, oriented parallel to the applied magnetic field. In this case the condensation energy (per unit length) in the vortex core <sup>1</sup> 8 µ0H<sup>2</sup> c ξ 2 , with H<sup>c</sup> the thermodynamic critical field, is equal to the maximum pinning elastic energy (per unit length) 1 2 kpξ 2 . Hence, the maximum k max p ≈ 0.25µ0H<sup>2</sup> c [\[44\]](#page-21-2) can be assessed in this ideal core pinning configuration. Using the literature value µ0Hc(0) ∼ 0.52 T [\[66\]](#page-22-8) for stoichiometric Nb3Sn, k max <sup>p</sup> ∼ 50 kN/m<sup>2</sup> is obtained. This k<sup>p</sup> upper limit is near to that measured on 100 nm film pristine YBCO [\[62\]](#page-22-4).

We show in Figure [8a](#page-13-0) the depinning frequency ν<sup>p</sup> measured in FC condition at µ0H = {2, 4, 8, 12} T and obtained with Eq. [\(3\)](#page-3-0). We can see that it is almost constant at low

**Caption:** Figure 6: Depinning frequency (νp) measured at various applied magnetic fields (2, 4, 8, 12 T) under field cooling conditions, reflecting the transition behaviors input by the Gittleman-Rosenblum (GR) model. The data, smoothed with shaded standard deviation, offers directional insights with νp's field dependence at specified temperatures (6, 7.5, 9 K). νp remains constant at lower temperatures but diminishes upon approaching the depinning line. High νp values at low temperatures and high fields suggest potential application in microwave technologies, particularly in contexts requiring minimal dissipation at GHz frequencies .

enough temperature (i.e. for T/Tc<sup>2</sup> < 0.7) and it sharply decreases approaching the depinning line as described in Sec. [5.2.2.](#page-11-1) In Figure [8b](#page-13-0) the νp(H) field dependence at T = {6, 7.5, 9} K is shown. We note that at the lower T νp(H) starts to decrease above µ0H = 4 T, while at lower fields it tends to saturate at ν<sup>p</sup> ∼ 6.5 GHz. The measured values are quite large also at high fields, ν<sup>p</sup> > 4 GHz at 12 T and low T which is larger than that exhibited by thin Nb films. It is known that ν<sup>p</sup> is strongly dependent on the sample thickness in Nb films: ν<sup>p</sup> ∼ 20 GHz in 10 nm Nb film at 0.2 T and 5 K [\[58\]](#page-22-0), ν<sup>p</sup> ∼ 5 GHz in 60 nm Nb film at 0.6 T [\[59\]](#page-22-1) and it falls to 1 GHz for 160 nm films in 0.2 T and 5 K [\[58\]](#page-22-0). In Nb the increase of ν<sup>p</sup> with the lowering of the film thickness was attributed to the dominant effect of the surface pinning centres [\[58\]](#page-22-0). This effect is masked in thicker samples due to the increased volume interested by the weaker volume pinning in Nb [\[58\]](#page-22-0). Moreover, it is well known that the main contribution to pinning in Nb3Sn [\[67](#page-22-9)[–70\]](#page-22-10) as in other intermetallic compounds [\[71,](#page-22-11) [72\]](#page-22-12) and metals as Nb [\[73](#page-22-13)[–75\]](#page-22-14) is given by the grain boundaries and that the pinning efficiency is inversely proportional to the average grains size. Since in Nb3Sn the grain size can be reduced by lowering the sample thickness [\[69\]](#page-22-15), it is reasonable to expect that for thin Nb3Sn samples ν<sup>p</sup> could reach very high values. This opens the possibilities to interesting RF applications of Nb3Sn films also in presence of high magnetic fields. Moreover, assuming a Nb3Sn sample engineered with a

Considering other superconducting materials, it comes out that the obtained values at 4 T are comparable with those measured in a MgB<sup>2</sup> thin film in the same H-T region [\[76\]](#page-22-16)). On the other hand, it must be noticed that FeSe0.5Te0.5 and YBa2Cu3O7-<sup>δ</sup> performances are still far, in fact at 12 K and 0.6 T ν<sup>p</sup> ∼ 22 GHz and > 40 GHz, respectively in 300 nm and 240 nm thick FeSe0.5Te0.5 films [\[77,](#page-22-17) [78\]](#page-22-18) while ν<sup>p</sup> ∼ 50 GHz in 100 nm thick YBa2Cu3O7-<sup>δ</sup> films at 72 K [\[62\]](#page-22-4). For a more complete comparison, thin Nb3Sn films should be characterized in the same conditions to experimentally verify the increase of ν<sup>p</sup> with the reduction of the sample thickness. Despite of this, from this study, it is shown that bulk Nb3Sn could remain a good choice for applications that work at not too high frequencies (e.g. radio frequency cavities for axions detection [\[79\]](#page-22-19)) and for which the use of a metallic and wieldy material is an important requirement.

*5.2.4. Evaluation of the thermal creep contribution.* We complete this work by providing an estimate of the thermal creep contribution to the evaluation of the vortex parameters through a statistical analysis according to [\[40\]](#page-21-0). We derive the maximum creep factor max and the lower limit for the activation energy U0,min. We then derive a confidence interval for the characteristic frequency ν<sup>c</sup> (we recall that when creep is taken into account, the characteristic frequency is no longer νp, but νc, see Eq. [\(3\)](#page-3-0) and Eq. [\(4\)](#page-3-1)). √

The maximum creep factor max = 1 + 2r <sup>2</sup> − 2r 1 + r 2 , with r = ρ 00 vm/ρ<sup>0</sup> vm, is obtained from analytical constraints [\[40\]](#page-21-0). Then, the corresponding minimum activation energy is determined with the CC model, in the scenario of a periodic pinning potential, since = (I0(U0(T, B)/(2kBT)))<sup>−</sup><sup>2</sup> [\[33\]](#page-21-8) with I<sup>0</sup> the modified Bessel function of first kind.

**Caption:** Figure 4: This figure shows the lower limit of the creep activation energy U0,min(T, H) across various temperatures for different magnetic field strengths (2, 4, 8, 12 T) during field-cooled conditions, with a scaling fit presented in the inset. U0,min exhibits non-monotonic temperature dependence, indicative of the decreasing effectiveness of pinning at higher fields, as suggested by the formula U0 ∝ Hc²ξ. The data illustrates the theoretical model's application, indicating the three-dimensional correlated volume of thermally activated fluxons (n=3). These findings enhance understanding of vortex pinning energies, crucial for optimizing superconductive material performance under varied thermal and magnetic scenarios.


Figure 9: Lower limit of the creep activation energy U0,min(T, H) in FC at µ0H = {2, 4, 8, 12} T. We show an almost perfect scaling of the U0,min(T, H) curves in the inset. The continuous line in the inset is the fit realized with the normalized U<sup>0</sup> ∝ H<sup>2</sup> c ξ n .

show a non-monotonic temperature dependence with a peak height which becomes smaller, and moves at lower T, as the field is increased. This behavior is expected for U<sup>0</sup> since at higher H values the pinning becomes less effective. Since U<sup>0</sup> ∝ H<sup>2</sup> c ξ n , then the U<sup>0</sup> temperature dependence can be evaluated from H<sup>c</sup> = Φ0/(µ<sup>0</sup> √ 8πλξ) and using the BCS λ previously used for the data analysis and ξ = q Φ0/(2πµ0Hc2) [\[27\]](#page-21-1) with the measured Hc<sup>2</sup> from Figure [6.](#page-11-0) The n = 0, 1, 2, or 3 parameter depends on the relevant length scale for the pinning energy: it indicates the dimensions of the correlated volume of the fluxons bunch that is thermally activated. From the theoretical behavior for U0, the observed non-monotonic trend can be obtained only with n = 3. Keeping this value for n, a tentative comparison between the theoretical curve and the experimental data, arbitrarily scaled with the constraint U0min < U<sup>0</sup> for each T, is reported in the inset of Figure [9.](#page-15-0) Assuming that the temperature behavior U0,min(T) reflects U0(T), n = 3 is an indication that in this sample the vortices correlated volume has a length scale ξ along the three spatial directions. It must be noticed that the peak in U0,min is narrower than what expected from the theory and also that the lower temperature U0,min dependence does not saturate to a finite value but it is a linear function of T. The narrow peak and the increase of U<sup>0</sup> with the temperature was already observed in other superconductors [\[78,](#page-22-18) [80](#page-22-20)[–82\]](#page-22-21). This discrepancy with respect to the theory was justified introducing pinning models that included junctions and non-homogeneities [\[80,](#page-22-20) [83](#page-22-22)[–86\]](#page-22-23).

To evaluate the impact of finite flux creep on the estimate of the vortex parameters, one should know the statistical distribution of the activation energies. Although we can set U0,min from the data, a full knowledge of the statistical distribution is not available. We then model the distribution of U<sup>0</sup> as a rectangular (uniform) distribution, and we seek for an estimate of

The inset displays the cumulative probability distribution, indicating with 90% confidence that νc lies between 6.5 and 8.7 GHz, whereas with 68% confidence, it falls between 6.5 and 7.7 GHz.

the maximum (cutoff) U0,max. The latter is determined consistently with the models used in this analysis. In particular, in the ideal case one can assume that the measured k<sup>p</sup> is not dependent to the fluxon displacement (i.e. that the pinning wells have perfectly parabolic profiles) and that the wells maximum width is 2ξ. In this case the maximum elastic pinning energy is U0,max = 1 2 kpξ 2 l where l is the length of the effective pinning along the direction of the applied magnetic field [\[44\]](#page-21-0). According to the indication n = 3 (Figure [9\)](#page-15-0), l ∼ ξ, then we set l ' ξ. The coherence length is obtained from the previously determined Hc<sup>2</sup> (Figure [6\)](#page-11-0), ξ = q Φ0/(2πµ0Hc2) [\[27\]](#page-21-1) and from the GR model k<sup>p</sup> a first estimation of U0,max is obtained. Actually, since the creep is now taken into account, the U0,max estimation can be enhanced with a recursive approach: once U0,max is obtained from the GR kp, it can be used to calculate the creep factor to be used in Eq. [\(3\)](#page-3-0), thus a new k<sup>p</sup> can be obtained with the CC model. This in turns fixes , and a refined value for k<sup>p</sup> can be evaluated from the measured data and the fixed with the CC model. In this way U0,max is evaluated several times until (k i+1 <sup>p</sup> − k i p )/k<sup>i</sup> <sup>p</sup> < 0.01, with i the iteration number (e.g. at T = 9 K and µ0H = 2 T the problem converges in 5 steps). The U0,max obtained from the last iteration is used for the statistical analysis now presented.

With U<sup>0</sup> taken to follow a rectangular distribution between U0,min and U0,max, we recalculate the pinning parameters using Eq. [\(3\)](#page-3-0) with 1000 values randomly extracted from the U<sup>0</sup> distribution previously built. We show as an exemplary case the creep contribution evaluated on νc(t = T/T<sup>c</sup> = 0.5, µ0H = 2 T). We focus on ν<sup>c</sup> since it is the crossover frequency between the low frequency vortex elastic motion and the high frequency dissipative region. Thus in case of creep ν<sup>c</sup> is the parameter of interest for technological applications. The characteristic frequency ν<sup>c</sup> distribution, with its cumulative probability distribution, is shown in Figure [10.](#page-16-0) The expected value E[νc]CC = 7.4 GHz is about 20 % larger than the numerical value for ν<sup>p</sup> within the GR model in the same condition. At t = 0.5 and µ0H = 2 T, we evaluated with the CC model also the ρf f distribution obtaining (E[ρf f ]CC − ρf f,GR)/ρf f,GR ∼ 3 %. Whereas, at t = 0.5 and µ0H = 12 T, where the creep phenomenon is more intense, the discrepancy between the CC and GR valued parameters is about 35 % on ν<sup>c</sup> and 6 % on ρf f .

As expected from [\[40\]](#page-21-2), one can notice that the GR evaluation gives a lower boundary for νp, ρf f and kp. In particular, even if neglecting the thermal creep brings to an underestimation of the material characteristic frequency νc, a drastic difference is not expected from that obtained with the more complete CC model. Thus, it means that for the design of perspective RF/high field applications of Nb3Sn the ν<sup>p</sup> shown in Sec. [5.2.3](#page-13-0) can be treated as the worst RF performance of Nb3Sn but as an indication of a more realistic value of νc, the expected values shown in this section can be used. Whereas, regarding ρf f it can be assessed that the GR determination can be considered reliable since even at the highest creep rate its shift is modest (i.e. ≤ 6 %).

# **6. Vortex parameters comparison with other SCs**

In this section a brief comparison between the mixed-state microwave properties of Nb3Sn and those of other technologically interesting superconductors (i.e. MgB<sup>2</sup> and YBa2Cu3O7-<sup>δ</sup> ) is provided.

In order to keep the comparison as meaningful as possible, we compare data obtained mainly by our group on MgB<sup>2</sup> and YBCO with the same technique and with the use of the same physical model (e.g. the GR model). The MgB<sup>2</sup> data were obtained on bulk pristine and doped samples at 16.5 GHz and 26.7 GHz up to 1.2 T. Further details on the MgB<sup>2</sup> characterization are shown in [\[61\]](#page-22-0). For what concern the YBCO, the parameters used for the comparison come from several literature results on thin films [\[21,](#page-21-3) [22,](#page-21-4) [62](#page-22-1)[–64\]](#page-22-2), commercial coated conductors [\[87,](#page-22-3) [88\]](#page-22-4) and single crystals [\[89\]](#page-22-5). The vortex parameters are linked to each other by ν<sup>p</sup> = kp/(2πη) and η ∝ ρ −1 f f Eq. [\(8\)](#page-10-0). It is then useful to investigate the parametric plots as reported in Figures [11](#page-18-0) and [12.](#page-19-0) In Figure [11](#page-18-0) the comparison at µ0H = 1 T and T = 10 K is shown on the plane ρf f − νp. From this, one can notice that Nb3Sn shows the lowest ν<sup>p</sup> of the three SC materials. Despite of this, it must be noticed that the large MgB<sup>2</sup> ν<sup>p</sup> comes from its particularly large ρf f as shown in [\[61\]](#page-22-0). Thus, despite the larger νp, the µw losses are smaller in Nb3Sn with respect to those in MgB2, even above νp. In particular, in MgB<sup>2</sup> ρf f exhibits a non conventional Bardeen-Stephen behavior [\[61,](#page-22-0) [90\]](#page-23-0) due to the presence of the weak superconductive π−band. This makes MgB<sup>2</sup> advantageous for µw applications in the mixed state only in particular conditions, e.g. below the field values for which the smaller gap is suppressed. Finally, as shown in the previous sections, YBCO performances are still better than those of metallic SCs. On the other hand, the practical use of YBCO in large-scale µw applications like cavities is hindered by the difficulties in the deposition on continuous, and possibly non-planar, surfaces. It must be noticed that in Nb3Sn ν<sup>p</sup> is high enough for applications like the dark matter cavity detectors [\[79\]](#page-22-6), thus despite its lower ν<sup>p</sup> it retains its importance for µw applications.

**Caption:** Figure 7: Comparison of microwave (μw) vortex parameters—flux flow resistivity (ρff) and depinning frequency (νp)—for Nb3Sn, MgB2, and YBa2Cu3O7-δ at a field of μ0H = 1 T and T = 10 K. The data illustrates Nb3Sn's reduced μw losses and νp relative to MgB2's unconventional Bardeen-Stephen behavior due to its weak π-band. YBCO exhibits superior performance, although practical application challenges exist due to deposition complexities on certain surface types. These findings help elucidate material suitability for μw applications, particularly where energy efficiency and surface deposition properties are critical parameters .

From the technological point of view Figure [11](#page-18-0) shows a useful comparison of the µw most interesting parameters of these SCs at fixed working conditions (i.e. at µ0H = 1 T and T = 10 K). However, it can be useful to compare the different SCs also with a more physical approach, evaluating k<sup>p</sup> and η at the same reduced temperature t = T/T<sup>c</sup> and field b = B/Bc2. This comparison is shown in Figure [12.](#page-19-0) The higher k<sup>p</sup> in YBCO is caused by the single fluxon pinning in this kind of SC [\[44\]](#page-21-0), while in both Nb3Sn and MgB<sup>2</sup> it was shown that the vortex system is in the collective pinning regime [\[61\]](#page-22-0). However, it must be noticed that the kp,max here theorized for Nb3Sn corresponds to the lower limit for k<sup>p</sup> in YBCO. Thus, in theory if it would be possible to optimize Nb3Sn with artificial pinning centres effective at microwaves, the high frequency performances of Nb3Sn could be expected to be near that of YBCO. Finally, the viscous drag coefficient η = Φ0B/ρf f ∝< τ > shows that the quasi-particles scattering time τ in the fluxons cores is particularly reduced in MgB<sup>2</sup> because of the high normal carriers density coming from the suppressed π-band [\[61,](#page-22-0)[91\]](#page-23-1). In Nb3Sn η is about 3 times smaller than the lower η value in YBCO, thus even if for k<sup>p</sup> and ν<sup>p</sup> there is still room for improvement, the Nb3Sn microscopic properties would still limit the high frequency dissipation in this material.

The comparison between the Nb3Sn, MgB<sup>2</sup> and YBa2Cu3O7-<sup>δ</sup> µw vortex parameters shows that Nb3Sn exhibits intermediate performances between those of the other two SCs. However, the possibility of increasing kp, with artificial pinning centres optimized to work at µw in order to extend the single pinning regime in Nb3Sn, can be particularly interesting to obtain a metallic superconductor with improved µw pinning characteristics, close to that of YBCO.

Notably, Nb3Sn shows intermediate characteristics compared to the higher kp and efficient pinning mechanics of YBCO, yet offers potential enhancements with artificial pinning centers for improved microwave performance. Understanding these parameters is pivotal for developing superconducting materials for high-frequency applications, emphasizing their functionality in environments with varied electromagnetic conditions .

# **7. Summary**

A polycrystalline bulk Nb3Sn sample was characterized at 15 GHz in order to study the highfrequency vortex motion in high magnetic fields up to 12 T. The measurements were performed with a dielectric loaded resonator both in field cooling and zero field cooling conditions. The obtained normal state material parameters matched with the literature values. The upper critical field Hc2(T) was evaluated at the higher temperatures directly up to 12 T while at the lower temperatures Hc2(T) was obtained by the scaling of the flux flow resistivity ρf f in a self-consistent way: the scaling procedure based on the Bardeen-Stephen (BS) model [\[36\]](#page-21-5) ρf f /ρ<sup>n</sup> ∼ H/Hc<sup>2</sup> gave a Hc2(T) in agreement with the expected, from literature [\[39\]](#page-21-6), Makide Gennes (MG) behavior [\[37,](#page-21-7) [38\]](#page-21-8) confirming both the validity of the scaling itself and the conventional BS behavior of bulkNb3Sn. The Nb3Sn depinning frequency ν<sup>p</sup> reached rather high values, above 4 GHz even at 12 T and low T, indicating that Nb3Sn is suitable for radio frequency low loss applications up to few GHz in bulk form. Since ν<sup>p</sup> strongly decreases with the film thickness, as shown in Nb, higher ν<sup>p</sup> values can be expected in Nb3Sn thin films. The pinning constant kp(T, H) was found to decrease when the temperature and the field are increased due to the reduction of the pinning efficiency. In particular, a field dependence typical of the collective pinning scenario (i.e. k<sup>p</sup> ∝ H<sup>−</sup>0.<sup>5</sup> ) was shown. Despite the collective pinning, k<sup>p</sup> > 10 kN m-2 for H ≤ 8 T and T ≤ 8 K which is about 10 times greater the values found in thin Nb films [\[58\]](#page-22-7). An estimation of the maximum kp,max ∼ 50 kN/m<sup>2</sup> , corresponding to single-vortex core pinning, shows that an alternative path to higher ν<sup>p</sup> (from higher kp) might arise from appropriate defect engineering. In fact, only in the last years the necessity to operate at high frequencies and high magnetic fields emerged, while no particular material studies were undertaken for optimizing the superconductive properties in these harsh working conditions.

Finally, we provided an analysis of the impact of the thermal activation on the vortex motion parameters through a statistical method and using the Coffey-Clem (CC) model [\[33\]](#page-21-9). The creep activation energy U<sup>0</sup> distribution was modeled with a uniform distribution with upper and lower bound estimated consistently with the models and results already obtained. Although the results obtained with the Gittleman-Rosenblum (GR) model [\[18\]](#page-21-10) (assuming negligible creep) represent a lower limit for both ρf f and νc, we obtained that ρf f , evaluated with the GR model, can be considered a reliable determination while for t = 0.5 the expected value E[νc]CC ∼ 1.2νp,GR at 2 T and E[νc]CC ∼ 1.4νp,GR at 12 T.

This work represents, to our knowledge, the first report of the microwave response in Nb3Sn at high fields. The results here obtained are encouraging for the use of Nb3Sn in RF in high fields, although further optimization of the pinning can be needed for the specific requirements of high-frequency applications.
