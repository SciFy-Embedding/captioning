# **Abstract**

Seven distinct families of superconductors with critical temperatures at ambient pressure that equal or surpass the historic 23 K limit for Nb3Ge have been discovered in the last 25 years. <sup>10</sup>Each family is reviewed briefly and their common chemical features are discussed. High temperature superconductors are distinguished by having a high (≥50%) content of nonmetallic elements and fall into two broad classes. 'Metal-nonmetal' superconductors require a specific combination of elements such as Cu-O and Fe-As which give rise to the highest known Tc's, probably through a magnetic pairing mechanism. 'Nonmetal-bonded' materials contain <sup>15</sup>covalently-bonded nonmetal anion networks and are BCS-like superconductors. Fitting an extreme value function to the distribution of Tc values for the known high-Tc families suggests that the probability of a newly discovered superconductor family having maximum Tc > 100 K is ~0.1-1%, decreasing to ~0.02-0.2% for room temperature superconductivity.

### <sup>20</sup>**1. Introduction**

Superconductors have zero electrical resistance and behave as perfect diamagnets (known as the Meissner effect). This arises from the condensation of electrons near the Fermi level into Cooper pairs that behave as a collective quantum mechanical state – a superconductor is a charged superfluid. Thermal pair-breaking limits superconductivity to a maximum critical <sup>25</sup>temperature (Tc) above which the material shows metallic or semiconducting behaviour with a finite resistance. Superconductivity is also limited by critical magnetic fields (Hc) and current densities (Jc) at temperatures below Tc. The critical temperature is mainly determined by chemical composition and structure, whereas the critical fields and currents are also strongly influenced by microstructure and are often not optimum in homogenous materials. The electron-<sup>30</sup>pairing interactions are relatively weak, e.g. in comparison to magnetic exchange interactions, so that all known superconductors have Tc's well below ambient temperature. Cryogenic cooling is thus needed to exploit the useful properties of superconductors such as in power transmission cables, magnetically levitated trains, or SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) electronics based on the Josephson effect of tunnelling Cooper pairs. Increasing Tc towards ambient temperature is thus a major ambition for superconductivity research.

<sup>5</sup>The first century of superconducting materials research divides into two eras, the 'low-Tc' period from the 1911 discovery of the zero-electrical resistance transition in mercury until 1986 when the record critical temperature was Tc = 23 K in Nb3Ge, and the subsequent 'high-Tc' era, during which several types of chemically complex solids with Tc's up to 138 K have emerged. This review will briefly describe the seven distinct families of high-Tc superconductors (taken <sup>10</sup>to be those with T<sup>c</sup> ≥ 23 K at ambient pressure) that have been discovered in the last quarter century. The families vary in size from containing one to many chemically and structurally similar materials with a common physical mechanism for superconductivity. The overall chemical trends and possible future directions for materials discovery are also discussed.

# **2. High-Tc families**

# <sup>15</sup>**2.1 Cuprates**

High (critical) temperature superconductivity was born from the discovery of an unprecedented Tc = 35 K transition in Ba-doped La2CuO4 in 1986.<sup>1</sup> A flurry of activity in the following years led to the identification of many more superconducting cuprates, with the highest Tc of 138 K found in HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+<sup>δ</sup>. A fluorinated sample of this phase showed an onset Tc of 166 ± 1 K at 23 GPa pressure which is the highest measured superconducting critical temperature to date, <sup>2</sup> 20 and approaches the lowest recorded terrestrial temperature of 184 K. An enormous literature is available for the cuprate superconductors; some recent books and review articles are cited here.3,4,5,6,7 Although the pairing mechanism and a convincing explanation for the magnitude of Tc in this family remain controversial, the essential chemical features are clearly established.

- <sup>25</sup>The complex chemistry of the cuprates results from the requirement for several structural features, shown schematically in Fig. 1(a), to optimise superconductivity;
- 1 Copper oxide planes are essential. These have stoichiometry CuO2 and a geometry like that found in the MO2 planes of the AMO3 perovskite structure (Fig. 1(b)). Hence cuprates are sometimes described as 'layered perovskites'. Maximum Tc's are generally found for <sup>30</sup>materials with blocks of three adjacent, hole-doped CuO2 planes.
- 2 Electropositive cations, usually from the alkaline earth (Ca, Sr, Ba) or rare earth (La-Lu, Y) metals, act as layer separators in two distinctive structural roles. Large 'A' cations (typically Sr2+, Ba2+ or La3+) support additional coordination of a further oxygen to copper, and this can provide a connection to additional metal (M) oxide layers. Smaller electropositive 'B'

cations (usually Ca2+ or a small rare earth) separate CuO2 planes in multilayer cuprates without allowing intercalation of O between Cu's in adjacent planes which is detrimental to superconductivity. n CuO2 planes require (n-1) B cation spacer layers.

3 Blocks of one or two covalent metal oxide layers MOx (M can be Cu, Ru, Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi) <sup>5</sup>layers are connected to CuO2 planes via interplanar oxides in the AO layers. The MOx layers are sometimes termed the 'charge reservoir' as they compensate for the doping of the CuO<sup>2</sup>

planes although this can also achieved by non-aliovalent substitutions at the A or B sites.

 Hence many cuprates have compositions (MOx)m(AO)2Bn-1(CuO2)n = MmA2Bn-1Cu nOz, often <sup>10</sup>abbreviated as M-m2(n-1)n, e.g. the highest-Tc material HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+<sup>δ</sup> is abbreviated as Hg-1223.

**Caption:** This figure outlines the structural components of high-Tc cuprate superconductors, particularly YBa2Cu3O7. It includes an illustration with molecular building blocks—a CuO2 plane, interspersed with BaO and Y layers, forming a repetitive layered structure, typical of 'layered perovskites'. Important structural motifs are presented which influence the material's electronic characteristics, particularly in promoting superconductivity through layer separation by electropositive cations like Ba²⁺ and Y, optimizing plane interactions. The structural intricacies explained here directly relate to the superconducting properties and guide synthetic adaptations for performance enhancements .

**Fig. 1** Structural features of the high-Tc cuprate superconductors (a) schematic view of the key structural components, (b) a CuO2 plane, (c) the crystal structure of YBa2Cu3O7 with the repeat sequence of layers labelled following (a).

 The undoped cuprates contain Cu2+ within the CuO2 sheets and are antiferromagnetic insulators, with very strong antiferromagnetic Cu-O-Cu superexchange interactions of coupling strength J/k ~ 1500 K. Superconductivity is induced by doping the CuO2 sheets; electron doping (reduction of Cu2+) is effective in a few cases, e.g. Nd2CuO4, but for the majority including all <sup>5</sup>the highest-Tc materials, hole-doping is achieved by cation substitutions, increasing oxygen content, or by band overlap. The latter two mechanisms are found in many materials, e.g. maximum Tc's ≈ 40 K are obtained for x = 0.16 and y = 0.08 in the La2-xSrxCuO4 and La2CuO4+y systems respectively, both of which yield an average +2.16 oxidation state for Cu. Hole-doping through band overlap is less common, but is well-established in the important 93 K <sup>10</sup>superconductor YBa2Cu3O7 (also known as YBCO or (Y)123). This contains distinct CuO chains as the MOx layers in the above structural classification (see Fig. 1(c)), and Cu band overlap results in a formal charge distribution Cu2.6+Ba2YCu2.2+ <sup>2</sup>O8. Similar Ru-Cu charge transfer induces superconductivity in the ruthenocuprate Ru4.8+Sr2GdCu2.1+ <sup>2</sup>O8. 8 

 A simplified electronic phase diagram for the hole-doped cuprates is shown in Fig. 2. Initial doping of a Cu2+ <sup>15</sup>parent material disrupts long range antiferromagnetic order and the Néel transition is suppressed at 3% doping. Superconductivity appears above 5% doping – the intermediate region is found to be physically inhomogenous with both magnetic and superconducting correlations present. Further oxidation increases Tc to a maximum at 15-20% doping, above which superconductivity is suppressed and is no longer apparent above ~25% <sup>20</sup>hole doping. There is substantial evidence for a diffuse high temperature insulator-metal transition at which a pseudo-gap opens,<sup>3</sup> and this coincides with Tc for the overdoped superconductors. Above Tc, the cuprates have unusual normal state electronic properties that evidence strong electron-electron correlations, but at high doping levels they become more like conventional metals.

**Caption:** This figure provides a schematic electronic phase diagram for cuprate superconductors, mapping the phases as a function of hole doping, denoted by x, which correlates to the average Cu oxidation state (2+x). The vertical axis represents temperature (T), while the horizontal axis represents the hole doping percentage. The diagram highlights different regions, including antiferromagnetic, pseudogap, and superconducting phases, along with a broad area depicting a correlation-driven metal transition towards normal metallicity at higher doping levels. This diagram is crucial for understanding the phases of cuprates and their behavior under variations in hole concentration, directly relating to superconductivity optimization strategies and theoretical modeling of unconventional superconductors .


**Fig. 2** Schematic electronic phase diagram for cuprate superconductors as a function of the hole doping x (equivalent to average Cu oxidation state 2+x).

 In addition to the doping level, structural features are also very important for optimising Tc in <sup>5</sup>the cuprates. Buckling of the Cu-O-Cu bridges in the CuO2 sheets suppresses superconductivity and favours alternative charge and spin ordered insulating ground states, so large Ba2+ cations at the A type cation sites help to preserve flat CuO2 planes and high Tc's. Disorder arising from mixed A or B cations adjacent to the planes also suppresses superconductivity. Hence the highest reported Tc for single layer cuprates is 98 K for optimally doped HgBa2CuO4+<sup>δ</sup> (δ = 0.08) which has only Ba2+ <sup>10</sup>cations adjacent to the CuO2 planes, and relatively little additional strain and disorder from the small concentration δ of oxygen interstitials between the Hg sites.

 Coupling between nearby CuO2 layers separated by B cation layers also enhances Tc; the highest values are found in the Hg-family where Tc increases up to 138 K for n = 3. T<sup>c</sup> decreases for higher n most probably because the doping becomes non-uniform across <sup>15</sup>inequivalent CuO2 planes.

 The pairing mechanism for superconductivity in the cuprates remains unclear. The essential features for theoretical descriptions are the d-wave symmetry of the order parameter (the wavefunction describing the Cooper pairs has the symmetry of a dx2-y2 atomic orbital), the presence of strong antiferromagnetic correlations, and the pseudogap feature. A plausible 20 explanation is that antiferromagnetic fluctuations mediate the pairing instead of the electronphonon coupling found in conventional BCS (Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer) type materials.

### **2.2 Fullerides**

The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in copper oxides was followed by another

remarkable finding from a very different group of materials. After buckminsterfullerene (C60) was first identified and isolated in the 1980's, alkali metal fulleride derivatives were synthesised and superconductivity was first reported in K3C60 with Tc = 19 K.<sup>9</sup> The fulleride superconductors are highly air-sensitive which hinders their characterisation and limits their <sup>5</sup>practical utility. Nevertheless, the variation of superconductivity across the A3C60 family has been explored in detail and related alkaline earth and lanthanide-doped fullerides, with Tc's up to 8 K for Ca5C60 and Sm2.75C60, have also been prepared.10,11,12

 The main tuning parameter for the A3C60 superconductors is the interfulleride separation, represented by the unit cell volume per C60, as shown in Fig. 3. Tc increases up to a maximum <sup>10</sup>of 33 K for RbCs2C60 as the volume increases, but beyond this limit superconductivity is destabilised with respect to an antiferromagnetic magnetic ground state. Recent studies have found that Tc increases under pressure up to 35 and 38 K in the face- and body- centred cubic polymorphs of Cs3C60, respectively.<sup>13</sup> 

 The phonon-mediated BCS mechanism for superconductivity in the weak coupling limit <sup>15</sup>describes many aspects of the fullerides. Vibrational spectra reveal a coupling between the conduction electrons and high frequency vibrations of the C<sup>60</sup> 3- anions that strengthens as the interfulleride separation increases, and a BCS-type <sup>13</sup>C isotope effect is also observed. However, the transition to a Mott (magnetic) insulating state at limiting high separations is more similar to the breakdown of metallic and superconducting behaviour at low dopings in <sup>20</sup>cuprates and other unconventional high-Tc superconductors.

**Caption:** This figure presents a phase diagram for A3C60 fulleride superconductors depicting the relationship between the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and the unit cell volume per C60 molecule. The diagram illustrates a peak Tc at an optimal volume, beyond which Tc decreases due to the development of antiferromagnetic order. The x-axis represents the molecular volume (Å³) and the y-axis represents the temperature in Kelvin. The diagram is accompanied by an inset showing the face-centred cubic arrangement of the fulleride structure, emphasizing structural influence on superconductivity. These insights are pivotal in understanding how lattice expansion can modulate electronic interactions and phase stability in molecular superconductors .

### **2.3 Barium bismuthate**

The perovskite BaBiO3 undergoes charge disproportionation that results in a distorted crystal structure containing an ordered alternation of Bi3+ and Bi5+ sites (Fig. 4). Suppression of charge order in Ba2Bi3+Bi5+O6 to give a superconductor was first demonstrated by substituting Pb for Bi, and the maximum Tc in this system is 13 K.<sup>14</sup> <sup>5</sup>Renewed interest following the discovery of superconductivity in cuprates led to the further discovery of Tc's up to 30 K in Ba1-xKxBiO3. 15 The phase diagram for this system<sup>16</sup> in Fig. 4 shows that superconductivity emerges with the maximum Tc immediately beyond the suppression of the charge ordered state at x = 0.38 and diminishes with further doping up to the x = 0.5 stability limit of the solid solution.

![](_page_6_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Caption:** This schematic phase diagram illustrates the temperature-dependent phase transitions in Ba1-xKxBiO3, focusing on the onset of superconductivity as doping level x changes. The y-axis represents temperature (T), while the x-axis represents dopant concentration (x), specifically in relation to the charge-ordered insulating phase and its suppression. Superconductivity appears as a dome peaking shortly after the disappearance of charge order at around x = 0.38, signifying the critical threshold where charge modulation turns conducive to superconductivity. This diagram underscores the delicate interplay between structural changes and electronic ground states in Barium Bismuthate, furthering understanding of charge order suppression as a path to emergent superconducting phases .

**Fig. 4** Schematic Ba1-xKxBiO3 phase diagram (temperature not to scale) showing the onset of superconductivity above the x = 0.38 limit of the charge ordered phase. The inset shows the charge ordered perovskite superstructure of Ba2Bi3+Bi5+O6 with light/dark shading of the Bi3+/Bi<sup>5</sup> octahedra.

 As superconductivity is only found in the three-dimensional bismuthate perovskite structure there are few chemical variations. Sr1-xKxBiO3 and Sr1-xRbxBiO3 analogues have been prepared at high pressure, but these have lower Tc's of 12 and 13 K respectively.<sup>17</sup> The large radii and good size matching of Ba2+ and K<sup>+</sup> ions appear to be optimal for superconductivity in doped-<sup>20</sup>BaBiO3.

 Optical spectra show that Ba1-xKxBiO3 is an s-wave superconductor (like conventional low-T<sup>c</sup> materials),<sup>18</sup> but the electron-phonon coupling constant was found to be too small for conventional BCS coupling to explain the high Tc. Electron-phonon coupling may be enhanced by electron-electron interactions in negative-(Hubbard) U models, which follow the negative-U description of the disproportionation of the average s 1 configuration to give ordered s<sup>0</sup> and s<sup>2</sup> 25

states in the BaBiO3 parent material.

# **2.4 Quaternary borocarbides**

Many rare earth transition metal borides and carbides are superconducting but most have low T<sup>c</sup> values. However a specific family of quaternary materials with composition RM2B2C (R = rare <sup>5</sup>earth, M = Ni, Pd) were discovered to have Tc's up to the past record value of 23 K for YPd2B2C.<sup>19</sup> The structure (Fig. 5) consists of layers of isolated linear B2C groups between R and M layers. Magnetic R cations suppress superconductivity completely for R = Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, and Tb in the RNi2B2C series and a variety of antiferromagnetic states is found, but coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic order is observed for the later R = Dy, Ho, Er, Tm.20,21,22 <sup>10</sup>This strong coupling of the rare earth metal moments to the conduction electrons is in contrast to the RBa2Cu3O7 and RFeAsO series where the R-magnetism has little influence on superconductivity. The RM2B2C superconductors appear to be s-wave materials but with an anisotropic energy gap.

**Caption:** This figure shows the crystal structure of YPd2B2C superconductor, highlighting its metal-metal bonded palladium layers interconnected by linear BCB units, and with yttrium atoms located within the Carbon planes. The atomic arrangement and bonding illustrated here are crucial for understanding how structural configuration and hybridized bonding influence superconducting properties. This particular borocarbide class demonstrates distinct s-wave superconductivity characteristics with an anisotropic energy gap. The figure captures the mixed influence of metallic and nonmetallic components on electronic states conducive to high-Tc superconductivity and illustrates the structural pathways to optimize superconducting transition temperatures in borocarbide materials.

### **2.5 Intercalated Nitride Halides**

MNX (M = Zr, Hf; X = Cl, Br, I) phases are insulators that contain hexagonal X(MN)2X layers <sup>20</sup>which may be stacked in several polymorphic arrangements. Chemical or electrochemical intercalation of alkali metals (Li, Na, K) into the van der Waals gaps between the layers (Fig. 6(a)), or removal of a small amount of halogen X, dopes electrons into the M d-band inducing superconductivity.23,24 The maximum observed Tc in this family is in the original report of 25.5 K for Li0.48(THF)yHfNCl containing cointercalated tetrahydrofuran solvent (THF).<sup>25</sup> Intercalation staging has been observed in NaxHfNCl, and Tc's of 24 and 20 K were reported for the stage 1 and 2 materials respectively.<sup>26</sup> The intercalated MNX phases are very air-sensitive which has hampered study of their physical properties.

**Caption:** This figure depicts the crystal structures of intercalated nitride halide superconductors, highlighting structural variations. (a) NaxHfNCl displays hexagonal layers intercalated with alkali metals, while (b) shows LixTiNCl with an orthorhombic lattice type. These structures illustrate the crucial role of interlayered alkali atoms in facilitating electron doping and superconductivity. The differences in structural symmetry between Hf and Ti materials reveal that superconductivity is not uniquely tied to one lattice type, offering versatility for exploring new superconducting systems .

**Fig. 6** Crystal structures of (a) NaxHfNCl and (b) LixTiNCl showing alkali metals intercalated between hexagonal and orthorhombic MNCl layers respectively.

 Superconductivity with maximum Tc = 16.3 K has recently been reported in AxTiNCl (A = Li, Na, K, Rb),<sup>27</sup> where the constituent layers have an orthorhombic (FeOCl type) structure that differs from that of the Zr and Hf based materials (Fig. 6(b)). This reveals that superconductivity is not specific to one underlying lattice symmetry in this family.

<sup>15</sup>Physical measurements show that the nitride halides are not conventional BCS superconductors and have a large superconducting gap ratio 2∆/kBTc = 4.6–5.6. In the LixZrNCl system, the maximum Tc is observed for minimum x = 0.06 doping, below which a magnetic insulating state is observed.<sup>28</sup>

### <sup>20</sup>**2.6 Magnesium diboride**

The discovery of high-Tc superconductivity at 39 K in MgB2 in 2001 was one of the most unexpected developments in this field.<sup>29</sup> Transition metal diborides were explored extensively during the low-Tc era but the magnesium analogue, which is a standard, air-stable chemical reagent, was thought to be uninteresting as it is has no available d-states. Subsequent measurements have shown that MgB2 can have a Tc of up to 41 K in thin films and can be processed into practical conductors, with critical current densities of up to Jc = 3.4 × 10<sup>7</sup> Acm-2 reported.<sup>30</sup>

 MgB2 has a layered structure with magnesium atoms between graphitic boron sheets (Fig. 7). <sup>5</sup>It appears to be an optimum superconductor 'as is', and doping or substitutions of other metals for Mg or of C for B have not enhanced Tc. However, this discovery has inspired reinvestigation of graphite intercalation compounds resulting in several new superconductors with Tc's up to 11.5 K in CaC6. <sup>31</sup> Extensive physical measurements have shown that MgB2 is a near-perfect BCS superconductor, with an isotope-effect increase of approximately 1 K in Tc when <sup>11</sup>B is replaced by <sup>10</sup>B.<sup>32</sup> <sup>10</sup>An important feature is the presence of two superconducting gaps with 2∆/kBTc values of 1.1 and 4.0 resulting from Cooper pairing of electrons in σ and π-bands, respectively. The latter value is close to the BCS s-wave value of 3.53. Coupling between the two gap pairings results in the single, observed superconducting transition.

![](_page_9_Figure_2.jpeg)

**Caption:** This figure illustrates the hexagonal crystalline structure of MgB2, highlighting layers of boron sheets interspersed with magnesium atoms. This configuration is critical to its superconducting properties, serving as a prototype for BCS superconductivity. The structural details elucidate the unique electronic band interactions responsible for MgB2’s superconducting phase and reinforce the relevance of crystal architecture in influencing electronic properties conducive to strong electron-phonon coupling .

### **2.7 Iron Arsenides**

The final family provides an appropriately symmetric closure to the first quarter century of high <sup>20</sup>temperature superconductor discovery, with very high Tc's second only to those of the cuprates, and many chemical and physical similarities.<sup>33</sup> They are based on FeAs layers in which Fe is tetrahedrally coordinated by As atoms (Fig. 8) and several structure types with different additional layers are known. A comprehensive review of the field has recently been published.<sup>34</sup>

 High-Tc's were first reported in the electron-doped LaFeAsO1-xFx series<sup>35</sup> and subsequent <sup>25</sup>study of rare earth RFeAsO1-xFx and oxygen-deficient RFeAsO1-<sup>δ</sup> analogues led to discovery of the highest Tc = 55 K to date in SmFeAsO1-xFx. <sup>36</sup> Hole-doped materials are also
superconducting; La0.85Sr0.15FeAsO has Tc = 25 K;<sup>37</sup> and in the related AFe2As2 and AFeAs families, Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 has Tc = 38 K <sup>38</sup> and LiFeAs has Tc = 18 K.<sup>39</sup> 

 Superconductivity is also observed in analogues where Fe or As are replaced by similar elements, but with lower Tc's. The binary phase Fe1+xSe containing only the FeAs-type layers is superconducting with Tc = 9 K for a small Fe excess x = 0.01,<sup>40</sup> <sup>5</sup>and Tc increases up to 14 K for Fe1+xSe0.6Te0.4. LaFePO has Tc = 6.6 K.<sup>41</sup> Non-Fe analogues such as LaNiPO and LaNiAsO, BaM2As2 (M = Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh) and BaM2P2 (M = Ni, Rh, Ir), and LiFeP have Tc's <5 K.

**Caption:** This figure illustrates the electronic and structural phase diagram of iron arsenide superconductors, specifically RFeAsO1-xFx, in relation to the electron doping level x. The phase changes are depicted with temperature (T) on the y-axis against doping levels on the x-axis. It highlights transitions from antiferromagnetic to superconducting phases, alongside structural modifications from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetries upon electron doping. The inset visualizes the crystal structure, showing the stacking of RO and FeAs slabs. This diagram emphasizes the importance of structural symmetry in achieving high-temperature superconductivity and demonstrates how doping levels influence phase stability and superconductivity emergence in iron arsenides, underscoring parallels with cuprate superconductors while highlighting intrinsic metallicity.


**Fig. 8** Schematic electronic and structural phase diagram for RFeAsO1-xFx iron arsenide <sup>10</sup>superconductors as a function of the electron doping x (equivalent to average Fe oxidation state 2 x). The inset shows the stacking of RO and FeAs slabs in the crystal structure.

 The electronic phase diagram for the high-Tc iron arsenide superconductors (Fig. 8) appears similar to that of the cuprates, although an important difference is that the parent materials are <sup>15</sup>metallic whereas the undoped cuprates are Mott insulators. Hence the observed antiferromagnetic order of small (0.1-1 µB) Fe moments is probably a spin density wave rather than an array of local moments. Doping suppresses the long range antiferromagnetism and superconductivity emerges with a high Tc for 10-20% doping. The competing ground states stabilise different lattice symmetries. The spin order is antiferromagnetic along one of the two <sup>20</sup>in-plane axes but ferromagnetic in the perpendicular direction, which drives an orthorhombic distortion of the ideal tetragonal structure. However, superconducting phases are tetragonal as the spin density wave is suppressed. The structural transition occurs above the Néel temperature, as shown in Fig. 8, and probably reflects the onset of antiferromagnetic fluctuations. Coexisting antiferromagnetic and superconducting phases are found in the 25 crossover region for some systems. Tc is very sensitive to lattice effects and is optimised when the As-Fe-As angle in the tetrahedral layers is close to the geometric ideal of 109.5°,<sup>42</sup> as shown in Fig. 9.

 Two gaps with s-wave symmetry have been found in many experiments and the values of 2∆/kBTc fall into the range 1-4 and 5-9. As for MgB2, coupling between the two orders results in <sup>5</sup>a single superconducting transition. The emergence of superconductivity from a consistent magnetic state in the iron arsenides provides strong evidence for an antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation pairing model, as for the cuprates.

**Caption:** In this figure, the influence of the Fe-As-Fe bond angle and unit cell volume on the critical temperature (Tc) of iron arsenide superconductors is displayed. The upper panel depicts variations in the Fe-As-Fe angle, while the lower panel shows corresponding changes in Tc, specifically for RFeAsO1-xFx and RFeAsO1-δ, using different rare earth elements (R). It demonstrates an optimal superconducting Tc at a near-ideal tetrahedral angle of 110.6°, underpinning the essential role of lattice geometry in high-Tc superconductivity. This highlights the geometric control mechanism in adjusting electronic band structures affecting superconducting transitions .

The overall maximum Tc = 56 K obtains for an angle of 110.6°, close to the ideal tetrahedral angle. (Adapted from ref. 42.)

# **3. Chemical Commonalities**

15 The seven families of high temperature superconducting materials do not fall into a welldefined chemical group. However, one general feature that clearly distinguishes the high-Tc set from the metals and alloys that dominated the low-Tc era is apparent from the simple chemical sorting shown in Fig. 10. This follows the standard classification of the elements as metals or nonmetals. A plot of Tc against the atomic fraction of nonmetal shows that all of the highest T<sup>c</sup> <sup>20</sup>materials have at least 50% nonmetal content, whereas Nb3Ge and the alloys that dominated the low-Tc era have <50% nonmetal. This plot follows the Edwards and Sienko classification of elements based on refractivity/volume ratios,<sup>43</sup> in which As and Ge are respectively a nonmetal and metal, but the above observation is unchanged if Ge is taken to be a nonmetal. In only one of the seven families, the iron arsenides, are some high-Tc materials with <50% nonmetal content observed, and even here the highest-Tc member of the family, SmFeAsO1-xFx, has 50% nonmetal content. In this context, the AFe2As2 family with Tc's up to 38 K in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As<sup>2</sup> are notable as the only metal-rich materials to have exceeded the 23 K limit.

<sup>5</sup>A well-known physical truism is that '*a good superconductor is a bad metal*', meaning that the electron-pairing interactions that give rise to superconductivity also diminish conductivity in the normal state above Tc. The equivalent chemical statement is thus that '*a good superconductor is mostly nonmetal*', meaning that the narrow bands and strong electronelectron correlations required for high temperature superconductivity are found in conducting <sup>10</sup>materials with a high nonmetal content.

**Caption:** This figure visualizes the relationship between the critical temperature (Tc) and the atomic fraction of non-metal elements in various high-Tc superconductors, plotted on a logarithmic scale. It compares seven distinct high-Tc materials and highlights Nb3Ge for reference. The graph emphasizes that high-Tc materials typically contain at least 50% nonmetals, showcasing the importance of nonmetal and metal bonds within these structures. This trend provides a pivotal chemical insight into the optimization strategies for discovering and developing future superconducting materials, focusing on nonmetal richness as a critical factor.

 As for many metal-nonmetal compounds, the electron distribution in high-Tc superconductors and their parent materials can be represented to a first approximation by ionic formulae based on typical valence states, e.g. (La3+)2Cu2+(O2-)4 and Sm3+Fe2+As3-O 2-, although the distribution Y 3+(Pd<sup>2</sup> 3+)(B2C 6-) implies some Pd-Pd bonding as is observed in the quaternary borocarbide <sup>20</sup>crystal structure. Further consideration of the roles of the metal and nonmetal in the high-T<sup>c</sup> families shows that there are two limiting cases. The first is where only metal to nonmetal bonding is significant. These 'metal-nonmetal' families (cuprates, iron arsenides, bismuthates and nitride halides) have structures that follow simple ionic principles, with metal and nonmetal atoms bonded to each other but not to themselves, leading to near 50:50 metal:nonmetal 25 compositions (between 40:60 and 60:40 for the high-Tc materials on Fig. 10). The oxide and

nitride halide superconductors have average anion charges of -2 and the presence of higher valent cations leads to nonmetal contents >50%. The AFe2As2 (and AFeAs) arsenides fall below the 50% limit because the magnitude of the anion charge is greater than that of the cations. From Fig. 10 it is apparent that the highest-Tc members of the cuprates and iron arsenides are <sup>5</sup>those with compositions closest to 50% nonmetal content, but the significance of this observation is unclear. An important chemical feature is that a specific metal-nonmetal pair is required to generate high-Tc's in these families. No obvious analogues to the Cu-O and Bi-O combinations have been reported, but in the other two cases optimum pairings with Tc > 23 K/suboptimal pairings with Tc< 23 K are evident; Fe-As/Fe-P,Ni-P,etc. for iron pnictides; Hf-<sup>10</sup>N/Zr-N,Ti-N for nitride halides. This demonstrates that superconductivity is very sensitive to the degree of nonmetal to metal charge transfer that occurs through orbital hybridisation. This group includes the most unconventional (least BCS-like) families, where metal-nonmetal orbital hybridisation is also important in strengthening the magnetic exchange that may mediate spin fluctuation superconductivity in cuprates and iron arsenides.

<sup>15</sup>In the second 'nonmetal-bonded' limit, nonmetal to nonmetal bonding is important, and the cations play a subsidiary role. This is best exemplified by the A3C60 fullerides where the alkali metal cations act only as spacers for the fulleride anions and do not contribute to the electronic states near the Fermi level. MgB2 is close to this limit although here some B to Mg charge transfer is important to the electronic structure. The presence of covalent bonding between <sup>20</sup>nonmetal atoms leads to a lower anion charge per atom and hence higher nonmetal contents; MgB2 contains (B- )∞ sheets and the fullerides contain discrete C<sup>60</sup> 3- anions. This group of high temperature superconductors is more BCS-like, with nonmetal-nonmetal bonding leading to narrow bands and high vibrational frequencies, and hence strong electron-phonon coupling. However, the antiferromagnetism observed at the limit of superconductivity in fullerides may <sup>25</sup>also be relevant.

 The quaternary borocarbides are intermediate between the above two limits as they contain strongly bonded, discrete B2C groups but also show chemical specificity for Pd over Ni or other metals and have a 50:50 metal-nonmetal composition. Of the seven high temperature superconductor families, this is the only one to show prominent metal-metal bonding, and as the <sup>30</sup>Tc does not exceed that of Nb3Ge, it could equally be regarded as 'low Tc'.

# **4. Future Prospects**

The first 25 years of the high-Tc era have been spectacularly productive, with a new T<sup>c</sup> ≥ 23 K superconductor family discovered every few years. As noted above, each family is chemically distinct from the others, so prediction of future discoveries is difficult, however some indicators are evident.

 Based on the known high-Tc materials, future high-Tc superconductors are likely to have a substantial (≥50%) nonmetal content. Very high Tc's are associated with a specific pairing in <sup>5</sup>the 'metal-nonmetal' group, and have nonmetal contents of 40-60% and structures in keeping with simple ionic bonding considerations. Neither element may have featured in previous high-Tc families, as for Fe and As prior to 2008. Spin-spin fluctuations appear to be important to the superconducting mechanism in the highest-Tc cuprates and iron arsenide materials where magnetic transition metals are needed. However, f-block magnetism may also be beneficial, as found in the intermetallic heavy fermion superconductor PuCoGa5 which has Tc = 18 K,<sup>44</sup> <sup>10</sup>so incorporation of nonmetals into such materials might prove a useful aid to future discoveries. Non-magnetic mechanisms based on other electronic instabilities may also emerge, as for the bismuthate superconductors based on suppression of charge disproportionation.

 Chemical doping is required to suppress the spin or charge ordered ground state and induce 15 superconductivity in the metal-nonmetal families. This is typically achieved through nonaliovalent substitutions or non-stoichiometry, but can sometimes occur through a fortuitous band overlap, as in YBa2Cu3O7. However, disorder within the essential metal-nonmetal network tends to suppress superconductivity, and so additional parts of the structure that can be chemically tuned (the 'charge reservoir' in cuprates) are needed to obtain high-Tc's. This is <sup>20</sup>illustrated by the difference between the maximum Tc's of 13 K for BaBi1-xPbxO3 doped at the essential Bi sites, and 30 K for Ba1-xKxBiO3 doped at the secondary Ba sites.

 The second group of high-Tc materials is characterised by nonmetal-nonmetal bonding which may lead to very high nonmetal contents (potentially 100% for a purely organic superconductor). This group is limited to those elements that form strongly bonded covalent <sup>25</sup>molecules and networks, typically B and C, although similar nonmetals such as N, O, Si, P, S could also be incorporated. Superconductivity is BCS-like in this group and the maximum observed Tc to date of 41 K is in keeping with optimal BCS weak-coupling predictions. In these families the optimal electronic structures for superconductivity are achieved for the stoichiometric compositions A3C60 and MgB2 (and also YPd2B2C) and chemical doping does <sup>30</sup>not raise Tc.

 Structurally, most of the high-Tc families are based on layered arrangements, although the cubic structures of A3C60 and Ba1-xKxBiO3 show that this is not a strict requirement. Twodimensionality may be physically important for enhancing the pairing fluctuations needed for superconductivity. However, layered structures also offer far greater chemical and structural 35 flexibility than three-dimensional networks, and so it is more likely that the optimal conditions for superconductivity can be realised. The highest-Tc HgBa2Ca2Cu3O8+<sup>δ</sup> material represents one of approximately 30 chemically or structurally distinct cuprate subfamilies.

 Predictions of the highest-possible Tc's given the present known materials are extremely difficult. As estimates based on physical understanding of the mechanisms for high temperature <sup>5</sup>superconductivity are still limited, a statistical approach may be the most realistic approach to gauge the likelihood of discovering new high-Tc materials. Extreme value theory describes the probabilities of substantial deviations from the median in a large collection of values generated from a given set of rules, and is used to model the likelihood of occurrence of rare events such as mechanical failures or extreme weather.<sup>45</sup> Three limiting distributions are found, of which the <sup>10</sup>Fréchet type is appropriate to a variable bounded by a lower limit such as Tc > 0 here. The Fréchet probability distribution function is:

f(Tc) = (α/β)(β/Tc) 1+α exp(-(β/Tc) α ),

<sup>15</sup>and the cumulative distribution function is:

$$\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{T}\_{\mathbf{c}} \le \mathbf{T}) = \exp(-(\mathbf{B}/\mathbf{T})^{\alpha}).$$

Fig. 11 shows the distribution of maximum Tc values from the seven families known to have <sup>20</sup>maximum Tc ≥ 23 K (as shown in Table 1) plus Nb3Ge. Assuming that the total number of presently known superconductor families is NTot ~ 1000, f(Tc) values were obtained in 10 K intervals as n/NTot where n is the number of superconductor families with maximum Tc in the ranges 23 ≤ Tc/K < 33, 33 ≤ Tc/K < 43, etc. The f(Tc) fit shown has parameters α = 1.5 and β = 5. Improved estimates of these parameters could be obtained by analysing maximum Tc values <sup>25</sup>in the low-Tc region.

**Caption:** This figure shows the statistical distribution of maximum Tc values across different superconductor families, visualized as a Fréchet probability distribution. By categorizing Tc in 10 K intervals for materials with Tc ≥ 23 K, it predicts the likelihood of achieving Tc > 100 K or beyond. The x-axis represents the Tc range, while the y-axis measures the probability density. This distribution provides insights into the extreme value statistical analysis of high-Tc superconductors, offering significant implications for material discovery and theoretical understanding of upper limits in superconductivity.


**Fig. 11** The distribution of superconductor families according to their maximum Tc, binned in 10 K intervals for Tc ≥ 23 K materials. The curve has equation 1000f(Tc) with Fréchet function parameters as shown in the text.

<sup>5</sup>The probability of a superconductor family having maximum Tc > T is (1 - F(Tc≤T)) so from the above parameter values, the probability of a newly discovered superconductor family having maximum Tc > 100 K is 1%, decreasing to 0.2% for Tc > 300 K (room temperature superconductivity). These statistical estimates appear up to an order of magnitude too high as only one presently known family has Tc > 100 K, so ranges of 0.1-1% and 0.02-0.2% may be <sup>10</sup>more realistic, and even these should be treated with appropriate caution. On a statistical basis, several hundred new families of superconductor may have to be discovered to find another Tc > 100 K material, and perhaps many hundreds or a few thousand to realise the possibility of superconductivity at room temperature. However, more targeted approaches based on knowledge of known materials as presented here, or perhaps on new theoretical insights, should <sup>15</sup>reduce the chemical space to be explored.

# **Conclusions**

Seven distinct superconductor families with ambient pressure Tc's that equal or surpass the historic limit of Tc = 23 K in Nb3Ge have been discovered in the last 25 years. These high-T<sup>c</sup> <sup>20</sup>families are all nonmetal-rich unlike the metals and alloys that dominated the earlier low-Tc era. The high-Tc superconductors are chemically diverse, but broadly fall into 'metal-nonmetal' and 'nonmetal-bonded' groups. Materials in the former group are based on an essential metalnonmetal pair e.g. Cu-O, Fe-As and approximate to an ionic description where only metalnonmetal bonding is significant and the metal:nonmetal ratio is near 50:50. Superconductivity is <sup>25</sup>optimised in non-stoichiometric materials through chemical doping and leads to the highest known Tc's in the cuprates and iron arsenides, probably through a magnetic spin fluctuations mechanism, although other coupling mechanisms such as charge fluctuation interactions may also operate in this group. 'Nonmetal-bonded' materials contain covalently bonded molecular or extended anion networks and are BCS-like superconductors with Tc's up to ~40 K.

 Replicating the principal features of the 'metal-nonmetal' group may provide the best <sup>5</sup>chemical guidance to the discovery of future high-temperature superconductors at present. Layered structures are advantageous for introducing strong pairing fluctuations and provide a good opportunity for chemical and structural optimisation of Tc. The distribution of Tc values for the known high-Tc families follows a typical extreme values distribution and a statistical analysis suggests that the probability of a newly discovered superconductor family having <sup>10</sup>maximum Tc > 100 K is ~0.1-1%, decreasing to ~0.02-0.2% for room temperature superconductivity.
