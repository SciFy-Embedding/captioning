Abstract. Far-infrared re ectivity studies on the polycrystallic compound M gB2 with a superconducting transition tem perature To = 39 K were perform ed at tem peratures 20 K to 300 K . W e observe a signi cant raise of the superconducting to-norm al state re ectivity ratio below 70 cm } with a m axim um at about 25 30 cm - which gives a lower estimate of the superconducting gap of 2 (0) 3 3 4 m eV .

Recently superconductivity in the binary interm etallic com pound M gB 2 w ith a T c close to 40 K w as reported by A kim itsu et al. [1]. M ost studies perform ed on this com pound yet indicate that M gB 2 consistently behaves as a phonon m ediated superconductor within the fram ew ork of the BCS theory, probably in a strong coupling limit [2,3, 4,5]. Up to now no optical investigations of this m aterial were reported, and this is in part due to the poor quality of the presently available samples, which are sintered polycrystals. It is well know n, how ever, that optical spectroscopy is an extrem ely pow erfulm ethod for studying the m aterials in the superconducting (SC ) state and is able of providing information on such im portant param eters as the SC energy gap, penetration depth, coherence e ects, scattering m echanism , etc. [6,7].

In this short note we report on far-infrared re ectivity m easurem ents perform ed on a sintered pellet of M gB2 . We are fully aware that these experim ents bear inherent problem s, m ainly connected with the surface roughness, w hich we cannot overcom e at this point. Nevertheless, we have attem pted to extract in portant inform ation on the intrinsic properties of M gB2 from our re ectivity data.

M gB2 has a hexagonal structure w ith P 6-m m m sym m etry. It crystallizes in the so-called A B2 structure where the boron atom s are located at a prim itive honeycom b lattice, consisting of graphite type sheets. The structure of M gB2 is show n in F ig. 1; the dim ensions ofthe unit cellare a= 3.086 A and = 3.524 A , according to our X -ray analysis. The borons span hexagonal prism s; the large, alm ost spherical pores are led by M g which acts as a spacer. Sim ilar to graphite, the distance between the boron planes is larger by a factor of two compared to the intraplanar B-B bonds, and hence the B-B bonding is strongly anisotropic (two-dim ensional) .

Powder of high purity M gB 2 was pressed in a pellet and treated in Ar atm osphere at 900 C ; details on the sam ple preparation are reported in Ref. [1]. The quality of the sintered sam ples was checked by X -ray analysis, resistivity, and susceptibility measurem ents. In Fig. 1 the tem perature dependence of the dc resistivity and of the m agnetic susceptibility are plotted. The SC phase transition is characterized by a w idth of less than 1 K from resistivity and of around 5 K from the susceptibility m ea-

**Caption:** Figure 15 displays the temperature dependence of the dc resistivity and magnetic susceptibility of MgB₂, including field-cooled (F.C.) and zero-field-cooled (Z.F.C.) data, along with the unit cell structure depicted in the inset. The main plot presents resistivity in micro-ohm centimeters (µΩcm) against temperature in Kelvin (K), showing a noticeable drop near the superconducting transition temperature (Tc = 39 K), consistent with superconducting onset. The inset shows magnetic susceptibility in emu/g versus temperature, highlighting changes around Tc, with rapid decreases suggesting a high superconducting fraction. The inset structural diagram demonstrates the hexagonal structure with magnesium and boron atoms. This figure collectively highlights the superconducting transition and structural properties of MgB₂, essential for understanding the physical characteristics underpinning its superconducting behavior.

 ectivity is m ore sensitive to changes of optical conductivity due to opening ofthe superconducting gap.T hisexperim ental technique hasbeen previously used to m easurethes-wave gap ofN bN and thed-wavegap ofLa<sup>1</sup>:<sup>85</sup>Sr<sup>0</sup>:<sup>15</sup>C uO <sup>4</sup> [\[10\]](#page-2-0). In addition,norm alincidencespectra werecollected in the sam e frequency range,w hich were qualitatively consistent w ith the grazing re

In our m easurem ents,we have observed that the copperblock on w hich the sam ple ism ounted in the cryostat and the sam ple surface had quite di erent tem peratures. In orderto geta precisesurfacetem perature,an additional Pt therm oresistor was later attached to the sam ple face. It turned out that the tem perature di erence is strongly enhanced below 40 K ,suggesting that the large therm al gradient is due to strong lowering ofthe sam ple therm al conductivity in the SC state.In particular,the lowestsurface tem perature we could achieve was only about 20 K , w hilethecryostatcold  ngerwasatliquid helium tem perature.T his additionaltem perature calibration has been used in the analysispresented in this paper.H owever,we should note thatthe system aticerrorofthism easurem ent on this rather thick sam ple is about2-3 K .

**Caption:** Figure 7 illustrates the frequency dependence of the reflectivity ratio for polycrystalline MgB₂ at various temperatures in a superconducting state, measured in grazing incidence geometry (p-polarization). The x-axis indicates frequency in cm⁻¹, and the y-axis shows the reflectivity ratio Rp(T)/Rp(45 K). The spectra exhibit a significant raise below the critical temperature (Tc = 39 K) with a maximum observed between 25 and 30 cm⁻¹, aligning with theoretical predictions for a superconducting energy gap. The data demonstrates that the reflectivity ratio maximizes below the superconducting transition, aligning with models predicting the behavior of a non-uniform superconducting gap in this material. This graph provides crucial evidence of the optical response in MgB₂ being driven by the anisotropic superconducting gap and carrier condensation effects.

**Caption:** Figure 9 depicts the temperature dependence of the grazing incidence (p-polarization) reflectivity ratio of polycrystalline MgB₂, normalized to the reflectivity at 45 K. The x-axis represents temperature in Kelvin (K), while the y-axis displays the reflectivity ratio Rp(T)/Rp(45 K). The reflectivity ratio exceeds one below the critical temperature (Tc = 39 K), indicating superconducting behavior. This phenomenon occurs as the reflectivity in the superconducting state becomes prominent, signifying the opening of the superconducting gap. The pronounced changes are associated with the condensation of carriers and an increase in reflectivity below Tc. This figure substantiates the behavior observed in conventional superconductors and supports the interpretation of the optical properties of MgB₂ as indicative of the energy gap associated with superconducting pair formation.

 ection for an essentially two dim ensionalsystem is not alwaysan indication of the SC gap; for instance, the gap-like feature in the re
 ectivity spectrum ofpolycrystalline La1:85Sr0:15C uO 4 [\[8\]](#page-2-0)was later explained by the m anifestation ofthe c-axis Josephson plasm on [\[9](#page-2-0)]).

O n the other hand it has been anticipated that superconducting gap is not uniform and has di erent values for di erent foursheetsofthe Ferm isurface[11].W ith thisinterpretation theR R m axim um should correspond to them inim um value ofthe anisotropic gap.T hisisalso consistentw ith a large variation of2 valuesobtained from tunneling,R am an,photoem ission,and N M R techniques[5,12,13,14,15, 16,17]ranging from 4 to 17 m eV

In conclusion,we have investigated the opticalproperties ofsintered M gB2 in the norm aland superconducting state by m easuring the ratio of the re
 ected intensity in the superconducting state to that in the norm al state. A n increase of the ratio in the superconducting state is reliably detected and interpreted as the signature ofthe superconducting gap w ith the lowest value of 2 (0) 3 4 m eV .
