The binary compound V3Ga can exhibit two near-equilibrium phases, consisting of the A15 structure that is superconducting, and the Heusler D0<sup>3</sup> structure that is semiconducting and antiferromagnetic. Density functional theory calculations show that the two phases are closely degenerate, being separated by only ±10 meV/atom. Magnetization measurements on bulk-grown samples show superconducting behavior below 14 K. These results indicate the possibility of using V3Ga for quantum technology devices utilizing both superconductivity and antiferromagnetism at the same temperature.

#### I. Introduction

Combining superconductivity and antiferromagnetism could find useful applications in quantum spintronic devices. Superconductivity and magnetism were once thought to be mutually exclusive, as magnetic fields are efficient at closing the superconducting gap. Nevertheless, it was found that superconducting materials could contain 3d magnetic transition metal atoms and magnetic lattices as well<sup>1</sup> . Following that, high-T<sup>c</sup> cuprate superconductors were found to have exceedingly strong magnetic exchange<sup>2</sup> , while superconducting Fe-pnitides were found to have large Fe moments of several Bohr magnetons3,4. Of interest here are binary vanadium compounds such as V3Al that belong to a class of simple superconductor materials with A15 crystal structure5–8. Interestingly, V3Al was also synthesized in a non-superconducting D0<sup>3</sup> Heusler phase with antiferromagnetic (AFM) order<sup>9</sup> . This D0<sup>3</sup> phase of V3Al was predicted to be a gapless semiconductor10,11, and was found experimentally<sup>9</sup> to be a G-type antiferromag-

**Caption:** Figure 1 illustrates the crystal structures of V3Ga in two phases: D0₃ Heusler phase (left) and A15 superconductor phase (right). The D0₃ phase features a G-type antiferromagnetism with vanadium (V) and gallium (Ga) atoms arranged in a highly symmetric cubic structure, while the A15 phase displays a different coordination, associated with its superconducting properties. These structural differences underlie the varying physical properties and applications, highlighting the dual-phase nature and its significance in understanding the magnetic and superconducting behaviors within V3Ga systems.

net having a Neél temperature of T<sup>N</sup> = 600 K. One can draw the conclusion that V3Z-type compounds represent a class of hybrid materials with superconducting and magnetic properties at the same temperature, which could have applications in possible fault-tolerant quantum computers hosting Majorana modes and in other important quantum technology applications.

Another well-known compound in this family is V3Ga, which has been used in superconducting applications for many years<sup>12</sup>. This material has been known since 1956 to have remarkable low-temperature properties related to elastic constants, Knight shifts, electrical resistance, magnetic susceptibility, superconductivity and it has been investigated extensively both experimentally and theoretically (see e.g. Refs.13–19). The critical temperature of superconducting V3Ga in the A15 phase is 14 K.

V3Ga can exist in two near-equilibrium phases, the A15 superconducting phase and the AFM D0<sup>3</sup> phase an interesting and potentially useful result of their similar formation energies. Since the arrangement of atoms in binary V3Ga can accommodate both D0<sup>3</sup> and A15 structures, shown in Fig. 1, one must study the stability of these two phases. Density functional theory (DFT) was used here to compute the formation energies as a function of crystalline and magnetic structures. Previous theoretical calculations for the D0<sup>3</sup> structure of V3Ga by Galanakis et al.<sup>11</sup> have predicted a Heusler Gtype AFM phase with a Neél temperature well above room temperature, which makes the compound attractive for applications9,20,21. A recent study also reported on the similar formation energies of the two structures.<sup>22</sup> The present magnetization measurements on bulk samples show a strong Meissner effect indicating a superconducting transition temperature of 14 K.

#### II. Experimental Details and Results

Bulk samples of V3Ga were synthesized via arc-melting using an Edmund Buehler MAM-1. The ingots were subsequently annealed at 1050◦C for 48 hours in an Argon environment to promote homogeneity and quenched in an ice bath. The composition was confirmed using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to be within ±2% of the nominal composition. Magnetic measurements were performed in a Quantum Design MPMS XL-5 SQUID magnetometer in magnetic fields up to 5 T and temperatures from T = 2 to 400 K. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction was done using beamline 11-BM at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). The structure was refined using TOPAS.<sup>23</sup> Overall, the structural results determined that there was a mixed phase of both A15 and D0<sup>3</sup> of V3Ga. The Rietveld refinement analysis determined that the A15 was the predominant phase at 81% and the D0<sup>3</sup> accounted for 19% of the structural analysis (Supplemental Information).

Results of the magnetic measurements are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. In particular, Fig. 2 shows a magnetic hysteresis from the Meissner effect at low temperature, which is characteristic of flux pinning of the A15 type-II superconducting phase. The superconducting transition temperature T<sup>c</sup> = 13.6 K is deduced from the plot of the magnetization as a function of temperature as shown in the inset of Fig. 2. Dimensionless magnetic susceptibility is shown in Supplemental Information which indicates ∼ 90% superconducting volume fraction in line with expectations from the compositional analysis of the X-ray diffraction data through Rietveld refinement. The inset of Fig. 3 shows the magnetic moment as a function of applied field at T = 300 K. The moment is linear up to at least µ0H = 5 T, where the moment is only µ = 0.007 µ<sup>B</sup> per formula unit (f.u.). This linear-in-H moment is similar to that found in the AFM D0<sup>3</sup> phase of V3Al<sup>9</sup> . A focus on the superconducting properties of the A15 phase is presented in Supplemental Information which shows an Hc<sup>2</sup> of about 3.5 T for isothermal magnetization at 10 K. This value is significantly lower than the previously accepted value of 15 T at 10 K for the A15 V3Ga phase.24,25 The decrease in Hc<sup>2</sup> is most likely due to the antiferromagnetic phase from the D0<sup>3</sup> component which attributes significant magnetic signal at higher field. Previous reports of off-stoichiometry A15 V3Ga<sup>24</sup> did not alter the Hc<sup>2</sup> as drastically as the observed in the current system, therefore it is reasonable to attribute this significant decrease in Hc<sup>2</sup> as due to the antiferromagnetic signal of another magnetic V3Ga phase present in the assynthesized compound mixture. At higher temperatures there is a notable peak in the temperature dependence of the low-field (H = 500 Oe) moment at T = 360 K, shown in Fig. 3. A similar feature was seen in the temperaturedependent resistivity of V3Ga at 350 K<sup>22</sup>, however, the peak was not assigned to a magnetic transition. The similar temperature-dependent features in both the magnetization and the resistivity could arise from either a

The hysteresis around H = 0 reflects flux pinning characteristic of type-II superconductors. The inset graph further delineates the Meissner effect corroborating the superconducting transition at T_C = 13.6 K, offering insight into the magnetic properties of the A15 phase.

**Caption:** Figure 3 describes the magnetic properties of V3Ga, indicating a peak at T = 360 K under 500 Oe, suggesting a magnetic transition. The inset shows the magnetic moment at T = 300 K, revealing behavior characteristic of the AFM phase of the compound. Such findings are pivotal in understanding the thermal and magnetic behaviors of V3Ga.

structural or a magnetic transition. A small peak in the magnetization of an AFM is generally characteristic of a Neél temperature<sup>9</sup> , so there is a reasonable case to assign the small peak observed here in the magnetization of V3Ga to some type of magnetic transition.

#### III. Computational Details and Results

Density Functional Theory (DFT) within the projector augmented wave (PAW) as implemented in VASP26,27 was used for the electronic structure calculations. Various approximations were considered for the exchangecorrelation (XC) energy, such as the local density approximation (LDA)<sup>28</sup>, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)29–31, GGA+U (with the Hubbard U correction), and the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) meta-GGA32–34. We have allowed full lattice and spin relaxation. The calculations were converged to an accuracy of 10−<sup>8</sup> eV, while a convergence criterion in the optimization for the residual forces was 10−<sup>7</sup> eV/Å. Concerning the GGA+U, the Coulomb integrals U = 2.0 eV and J = 0.67 eV have been used that were provided by He et al.<sup>22</sup> .

The main results are summarized in Table I, while more details are contained in the Supplemental Materials. The general trend of correlation effects beyond GGA is to stabilize the D0<sup>3</sup> solution with respect to the A15 one. The ground state (GS) in both LDA and GGA is the ferromagnetic (FM) phase with A15 structure. When correlation effects are included, the GS becomes the AFM G-type D0<sup>3</sup> solution. Regarding the A15 solution, the effect of correlations is to stabilize an AFM-III solution22,35 with respect to FM one. Within SCAN, the FM and AFM-III solutions in the A15 structure are almost degenerate and within 5 meV/atom (FM is marginally more stable). However, GGA+U fully stabilizes the AFM-III solution. The AFM-III solution having a net zero magnetic moment is more compatible with the superconducting properties of A15 structure.

Given the observation of the dual phase in the present V3Ga samples, SCAN may exaggerate the stabilization of the D0<sup>3</sup> solution, while GGA+U gives almost degenerate A15 and D0<sup>3</sup> solutions within 15 meV/atom, a value found previously in DFT solutions<sup>22</sup> and is in better accord with the experiment. SCAN is also known to exaggerate the magnetic moment of transition metal atoms, which are well described within GGA36–38. In order to alleviate this problem, a modification of SCAN with deorbitalization has been suggested recently<sup>39</sup> .

The calculated electronic structure is represented by

**Caption:** Figure 4 shows the Density of States (DOS) calculation for the D0₃ phase of V3Ga, comparing results from various methodological approaches: LDA, GGA, GGA+U, and SCAN.

These analyses highlight differences in electronic structure potentially impacting magnetic properties and material usability across applications.

**Caption:** Figure 5 presents the relationship between Neél temperature (T_N) and disorder degree (x) in V3Ga, based on calculations involving the SPR-KKR-CPA approach. The inset shows the crystal structure model, indicating the substitution of Ga atoms with nonmagnetic V atoms, affecting the antiferromagnetic coupling within the lattice. The graph illustrates a decline in T_N as disorder increases, emphasizing the sensitivity of magnetic transition temperatures to atomic substitutions.


FIG. 5. Dependence of Neél temperature of V3Ga from disorder using calculations based on SPR-KKR package. Disorder was obtained by exchanging a fraction x of the Ga atoms with the nonmagnetic V atoms. Note that T<sup>N</sup> at x = 0 here is somewhat larger than that found using a more accurate simulation described in the text.

density of states (DOS) shown in Fig. 4. LDA and GGA schemes give an almost gapless semiconductor, while the effects of correlation beyond GGA within GGA+U and SCAN lead to the opening of gap with size of about 0.2 eV. Similar gap opening has been observed by Buchelnikov et al.<sup>40</sup> in other Heusler alloys.

In order to estimate the magnetic transition temperature for the AFM G-type D0<sup>3</sup> phase, the GGA solution is more appropriate. Using Monte Carlo simulations with ab initio exchange integrals and Heisenberg model<sup>35</sup>, we obtain the Neél temperature T<sup>N</sup> = 590 K, which is somewhat higher than the peak in the experimental M(T) data at 360 K that was extracted from Fig. 3. However, the Neél temperature is found to be strongly affected by disorder. Effects of disorder on the Neél temperature are calculated by using the mean field approximation implemented in the SPR-KKR packages. Figure 5 illustrates how T<sup>N</sup> collapses for increasing disorder when the Ga atoms are exchanged with the nonmagnetic V atoms (those V atoms lying between the two antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic V atoms). It is seen that T<sup>N</sup> goes to zero with 20% exchange. Thus, a reduction of the Neél temperature to T<sup>N</sup> = 360 K would require only 6% of the Ga atoms exchanging for nonmagnetic V atoms. However, we note that there is a sizeable energy barrier for V-Ga exchange. Nevertheless, these results illustrate the importance of the nonmagnetic V atoms to the exchange between the other two antiferromagnetically coupled Vatoms.

#### IV. Conclusions

We have studied the dual-phase superconducting A15 phase and the semiconducting AFM phase D0<sup>3</sup> in V3Ga. To rationalize our results, we have considered several models within DFT. We find that the effect of more accurate XC corrections within DFT is to eliminate or to weaken the total FM moment given by simpler LDA and GGA schemes in the A15 cell. This FM moment could jeopardize the A15 superconducting properties. Correlation effects also tend to stabilize the D0<sup>3</sup> solution. However, this trend could be exaggerated within SCAN. Concerning the formation energies, we believe that the most accurate results are between GGA and SCAN, therefore, we deduce that A15 and D0<sup>3</sup> phases are degenerate within an uncertainty of about 10 meV/atom. Finally, assuming that GGA gives the best description for the AFM magnetic moments of V atoms in the D0<sup>3</sup> solution, we estimated the Neél temperature to be T<sup>N</sup> = 590 K, but becomes lower with disorder in the atomic sublattices. Finally, the present results indicate the possibility of using V3Ga for quantum technology devices that require both superconductivity and antiferromagnetism at the same temperature.

## Details and Results of the VASP calculations

The geometric optimization and ground state calculations were performed for two structures (D0<sup>3</sup> and A15) of V3Ga, which are experimentally observed. In the case of D0<sup>3</sup> structure, the 16 atoms supercell was considered, in which Ga atoms locate at 4a (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) Wyckoff positions and V atoms take 4b (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and 8c ((1/4, 1/4, 1/4) and 3/4, 3/4, 3/4)) sites. For A15 structure, six-atom supercell was assumed, in which two Ga atoms occupy 2a sites and six V atoms locate at 6c sites. Concerning to magnetic subsystem, ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin alignments of V atoms were considered. For D0<sup>3</sup> structure, FM and AFM G-type orders were considered according to Ref. [11], while for A15 structure, FM and three AFM orders were proposed in accordance with Ref. [22]. The crystal structures as well as the magnetic configuration considered are illustrated in Fig. 1. To emphasize the AFM order, V atoms located at different sites were distinguished by labels 1, 2, and 3.

To consider the exchange-correlation effects, the following functionals were assumed in the electronic calculations: LDA-PZ [28], GGA-PBE [29– 31], GGA+U and meta-GGA-SCAN [32–34] parametrizations. For GGA+U scheme, the values of Hubbard-repulsion U and Hund-exchange integral J for V atoms were taken 2 and 0.67 eV, correspondingly, in accordance with He et al. [22]. The PAW pseudopotentials were taken with valence-electron configurations as follows: 3s <sup>2</sup>3p <sup>6</sup>4s <sup>2</sup>3d 3 for V atoms and 3d <sup>10</sup>4s <sup>2</sup>4p 1 for Ga atoms. The 10×10×10 k-points grid was generated using Monkhorst-Pack scheme. The kinetic-energy cutoff for the augmented charge was taken 750 eV. The Methfessel-Paxton smearing method [?] was used with a width of 0.2 eV in geometry optimization runs, and the tetrahedron smearing method with Bl´ochl corrections [?] was deployed in self-consistent calculations. The calculations were converged to an accuracy of 10−<sup>8</sup> eV. The convergence criterion in the optimization for the residual forces was 10−<sup>7</sup> eV/˚A.

Kohn-Rostoker) package [?]. For these calculations, the optimized lattice parameter obtained by VASP calculation for FM phase of D0<sup>3</sup> structure has been used. It should be noted that in this case, calculations were carried out for unit cell of D0<sup>3</sup> consisting of four atoms (3 V and 1 Ga). The exchangecorrelation energy was treated by the GGA-PBE parameterization [30]. For the self-consistent cycles calculations, 2300 k-points were generated by a kmesh grid of 45<sup>3</sup> . The angular momentum expansion (lmax) was restricted to three. The magnetic exchange constants were calculated on a k-mesh grid of 57 × 57 × 57 with 4495 k-points. All calculations converged to 0.01 mRy of total energy. The dependence of the exchange interaction parameter Jij on the distance between atoms d/a is shown in Fig. 2.
![](0__page_8_Figure_0.jpeg)

Figure 2: Exchange coupling constants Jij as a function of distance (d/a) between atoms i and j for V3Ga with D0<sup>3</sup> structure at their equilibrium lattice parameter

Here, the positive exchange constants (Jij > 0) presented FM coupling, whereas the negative ones (Jij < 0) indicate AFM coupling. It is obvious that the large FM interactions are observed between nearest neighbors V1- V<sup>1</sup> and V2-V<sup>2</sup> atoms. The magnitudes of these couplings are the same and about of 3 meV. While, they reduces sufficiently and becomes zero in the third and further coordination shells. The strongest AFM interaction (-5.5 meV) is observed between the nearest V<sup>1</sup> and V<sup>2</sup> atoms located at different sublattices. The all interactions with V<sup>3</sup> atoms are close to 0 meV during the zero magnetic moment in V<sup>3</sup> atoms (See, Table 1).

# Details and Results of the Monte Carlo simulations

To extend the zero-temperature ab initio results to finite temperatures, we further performed the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the classical threedimensional Heisenberg model (H = P ij JijSiS<sup>j</sup> ) in zero magnetic field. Here, S<sup>i</sup> = (S x i , S<sup>y</sup> i , S<sup>z</sup> i ) is a classical Heisenberg spin variable |S<sup>i</sup> | = 1 and Jij are the exchange coupling constants (positive in case of FM interactions and negative in case of AFM interactions depending on the distance between the atoms). The calculated exchange parameters (Jij ) and partial magnetic moments (µi) were taken as input parameters. Since, the Jij behavior versus the distance between atoms (d/a) shows the long-range oscillation trend, therefore we restricted exchange interactions up to sixth coordination shell for all interaction pairs.

The MC simulations were carried out for a simulation lattice with real unit cell consisting of 3925 atoms (1099 Ga and 2826 V atoms) and periodic boundary conditions by using the Metropolis algorithm [?], where, some new, random spin direction is chosen and the energy change which would result if this new spin orientation is kept, is then calculated. Changes of the independent spin variables S<sup>i</sup> = (S x i , S<sup>y</sup> i , S<sup>z</sup> i ) are accepted or rejected according to the single-site transition probability W = min [1, exp (−∆H/kBT)]. As a time unit, we used one MC step consisting of N attempts to change the spin variables. A new spin direction can be chosen by randomly choosing new spin components. The spin components are chosen in the following manner [?]. Two random numbers r<sup>1</sup> and r<sup>2</sup> are chosen from the interval [0, 1] to produce a vector with two components ζ<sup>1</sup> = 1 − 2r<sup>1</sup> and ζ<sup>2</sup> = 1 − 2r2. The length of the vector is determined by ζ <sup>2</sup> = ζ 2 <sup>1</sup> + ζ 2 <sup>2</sup> and if ζ <sup>2</sup> < 1, then a new spin vector is computed with components

$$S\_i^x = 2\zeta\_1\sqrt{1-\zeta^2},\ S\_i^y = 2\zeta\_2\sqrt{1-\zeta^2},\ S\_i^z = 1-2\zeta^2.$$

For each temperature the properties (internal energy of the system hHi and magnetic order parameter hmi) were estimated allowing 10<sup>5</sup> MC steps and 10<sup>4</sup> thermalization steps and were averaged over 2250 configurations for each 400 MC steps. The simulation started from the ferromagnetic phase with S z <sup>i</sup> = 1.

The magnetic order parameter is defined by the following way

$$m^{\alpha} = \frac{1}{N^{\alpha}} \sum\_{i} \sqrt{\left(S\_i^{\alpha, x}\right)^2 + \left(S\_i^{\alpha, y}\right)^2 + \left(S\_i^{\alpha, z}\right)^2},$$

where α denotes V1, V<sup>2</sup> and V<sup>3</sup> atoms and N<sup>α</sup> the total number of α atoms; i runs over the corresponding lattice sites of the α atoms. The resulting temperature dependencies of partial magnetizations of V1,<sup>2</sup> for V3Ga with D0<sup>3</sup> alloy at zero magnetic field is shown in Fig. 3.

In order to estimate the Ne´el temperature, we plotted m (T) = (m<sup>α</sup> ) <sup>1</sup>/β (T) function, which approximately linear decreases with increasing temperature. The Ne´el temperature can be estimated at the intersection of m with the T axis. Here, m<sup>α</sup> is the partial magnetization of V1, V<sup>2</sup> atoms and β is the critical index. Note, in the case of the three-dimensional Heisenberg model the β exponent is equal to 0.3646. Estimation give us Ne´el temperature T<sup>N</sup> = 587 K.

# Results of Disorder Calculations

The effects of disorder on the Ne´el transition temperature was computed with SPR-KKR package and KKR-CPA approach. The degree of disorder in the atomic sublattices was quantified by x, given by the fraction of Ga

**Caption:** Figure 3 depicts the partial magnetization of V3Ga with the D0₃ structure as a function of distance (d/a) at zero magnetic field, capturing the variation in magnetization for different V atom sites. This trend suggests complex magnetic interactions integral to the stability and characteristics of the D0₃ phase, crucial for potential technological applications.

atoms that are exchanged for nonmagnetic V atoms (labeled V3), where the nonmagnetic V atoms lie between the two antiferromagnetically coupled magnet V atoms (labeled V<sup>1</sup> and V2). The results of the calculations are shown in Table 3 for x = 0 to 0.2. For all those values of x, the V<sup>1</sup> and V<sup>2</sup> magnetic atoms have opposite signs and equal magnitudes, while the V<sup>3</sup> moment is zero. The Ne´el temperature is seen to decrease from T<sup>N</sup> = 630 K at x = 0 to T<sup>N</sup> = 0 at x = 0.2. Figure 5 in the main text shows T<sup>N</sup> as a function of x.

# Results of Rietveld X-ray Diffraction Analysis

X-ray diffraction of the V3Ga sample was taken at Beamline 11-BM at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Lab using a wavelength of λ = 0.413841 ˚A and the sample was rotated continuously. Figure 4 shows the XRD data and subsequent Rietveld and Pawley fitting procedures. [23] The experimental data is shown by the points and fit to the data is shown by the pink curve. The lower blue curve plots the experimental data minus the Rietveld fit. In this figure, only the A15, D0<sup>3</sup> and A2 phases were included as part of the Rietveld fitting procedure. The A2 phase is a disordered D0<sup>3</sup> phase where the V and Ga are randomly exchanged. Only including those three phases, it was determined that another phase was present. A search of relevant V, Ga and V-Ga binary phases (V6Ga5, V6Ga7, V2Ga5) were unable to accurately index the remaining peaks. Thus, an expanded search to contain impurity oxide phases was done. Through this, it was determined that the remaining peaks could be accurately indexed to a reported oxide impurity phase, V3GaOx. [?] The structure of the V3GaO<sup>x</sup> phase is not rigorously reported; however, the previous work discussed the structure as Cu3Au-type perovskite with Ga at the corners, V at the face centers and O at the body center. From this, a structure was built and space group determined through the use of Python Materials Genomics library. [?] Since the structure of the V3GaO<sup>x</sup> has not been determined as well as its existence as a minor impurity phase in the current work, it's contribution to the X-ray diffraction pattern was modeled only by a Pawley refinement procedure. As such, the weight fraction of the V3GaO<sup>x</sup> phase cannot be determined and all other reported weight fractions for the A15, D03, and A2 phases are reported relative to each other. The results of the fitting procedure provided the following approximate percentages of the various phases: 81% in the A15 phase, 18% in the D0<sup>3</sup> phase, and 0.1% in the A2 phase. An attempt to include the determined structure for the V3GaO<sup>x</sup> phase for Rietveld refinement yielded an approximate weight fraction on the order of 30 - 40%.

# Analysis of superconductivity of A15 phase

Additional analysis of the as-synthesized superconducting properties of the A15 V3Ga revealed superconducting critical temperature of 13.6 K and a superconducting volume fraction at 2 K of approximately 90% as shown in Fig 5. This was calculated from the density and phase fraction extracted from Rietveld analysis from synchrotron X-ray diffraction data for the A15 phase. Isothermal magnetization at 10 K revealed an upper critical field,

**Caption:** Figure 4 illustrates high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction patterns for V3Ga ingots at 295 K, with phase identification through Rietveld refinement analysis. The phases include A15, D0₃, and minor impurity phases. The lattice parameters and compositional details from the refinement offer critical insights into phase composition and structural transition temperatures, aiding in the understanding of superconducting and magnetic properties.


Figure 4: High resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction patterns for as-grown V3Ga ingots collected at T = 295 K. Red tick and green tick marks represent the targeted V3Ga phases, A15 and D0<sup>3</sup> phases respectively. Orange tick marks represent impurity A2 phase and purple tick marks shown the existence of an impurity oxide phase, V3GaOx. These are shown below the calculated, observed, and differences curves from Rietveld analysis. Crystal structures, corresponding extracted lattice parameters and elemental composition from Rietveld analysis, and relevant transition temperature for each phase are shown below the XRD data.

Hc<sup>2</sup> of about 3.5 T which is significantly lower than previous reports. [24,25] This may be due to a number of factors such as stoichiometric changes in the as-synthesized A15 V3Ga phase as well as the coexistence of another magnetic phase due to the V3Ga D0<sup>3</sup> phase in the as-synthesized sample. Thus, the assignment of an Hc<sup>2</sup> value to the A15 V3Ga phase cannot be done in a rigorous way. However, the extracted superconducting volume fraction and superconducting critical temperature matches with expectations.

**Caption:** In Figure 5, both the temperature-dependent dimensionless magnetic susceptibility at 500 Oe and isothermal magnetization at 10 K of V3Ga sample mixtures are shown. The data underpin the superconducting properties of the A15 phase and the impact of the concomitant D0₃ phase. The measurements confirm the mixed-phase nature of the sample, enlightening the scientific understanding of phase transitions and superconductivity in V3Ga.
