The nanostructure and magnetic properties of polycrystalline M qCN is were studied by x-ray di raction, electron m icroscopy, and vibrating sample m agnetom etry. W hile the bulk ux-pinning force curve F . (H ) indicates the expected grain boundary pinning mechanism just below To 72 K , a system atic change to pinning by a nanom eter-scale distribution of core pinning sites is indicated by a shift of Fp (H ) with decreasing tem perature. The lack of scaling of Fp (H ) suggests the presence of 10 to 20% of nonsuperconducting regions inside the grains, which are sn aller than the diam eter of uxon cores 2 at high tem perature and becom e e ective w ith decreasing tem perature when (T ) approaches the nanostructural scale. Transm ission electron m icrossopy revealed cubic and graph te nanoprecipitates with 2 to 5 nm size, consistent with the above hypothesis since (0) 6 nm . High critical current densities, more than 10° A / m - at 1 T and 4.2 K , were obtained for grain colonies separated by carbon . D irty-lin it behavior seen in previous studies may be tied to electing by the precipitates, indicating the possibility that strong core pinning m ight be combined with a technologically useful upper critical eld if versions of M gCN ig with higher To can be found.

The recent discovery [1] of superconductivity above 7 K in M gCN is suggests the possibility of a new fam ily of nickel-carbide superconductors. M gC N is the cubic cousin of layered RN i2B 2C com pounds (R = rare earth), w hich exhibit superconductivity up to 23 K for Y N i2B 2C [2]. It has been proposed that in analogy to copper and bism uth-oxide perovskites, the conduction in M gCN involves holes in the N i d states [1], which are usually responsible for magnetism . The possibility, therefore, of unconventional superconductivity has attracted great interest in the band structure and the physics of the pairing m echanism [3,4,5,6]. From an application point of view , it is interesting that M gC N is behaves like a dirty-lim it interm etallic superconductor, with a high resist.ivity and a steep slope of the upper critical eld H c2 at the critical tem perature Tc [7]. This produces oH c2 (0) values close to 10 T [7], com parable to the reported 8-15 T values for the layered, clean-lim it borocarbide com pounds [8] that have 2 to 3 tim es higher Tc.

In this Letter, we present evidence for nanom eter-scale precipitates in M gCN i3, which may explain why dirtylimit behavior is observed. Bulk pinning-force curves Fp (H ) derived from m agnetization data show a system atic change with decreasing tem perature, from behavior characteristic of grain-boundary pinning near To to behavior characteristic of core pinning at 1.8 K . This im plies the existence of intragranular pinning sites that are invisible to ux lines at high tem perature, when the ux-line diam eter 2 is large, but become e ective at low tem perature, when (T) is slightly larger than

(0) 6 nm . Evidence for both graphite and a cubic phase is provided by high-resolution transm ission elec-

tron microscopy (TEM ), where both phases have 2 to 5 nm size. These nanoprecipitates probably result from the processing of M gC N 13, since excess carbon is needed to get the highest values of T 。 [1]. M gC N is m ay thus be unique am ong interm etallic superconductors, since it can be made with intragranular core pinning sites that are necessary for strong pinning at high elds, a feature not found in e.g. N.b3Sn. M oreover, if analogs of this com pound with higher To retain this nanostructure, they should exhibit high upper critical eld, due to the election scattering by the nanostructure, in addition to strong core pinning. Such a favorable com bination is presently found only in Nb-Tialloy superconductors [9], which are the m ainstay of superconducting m agnet technology.

A M gC N is pellet from a batch reported in [1] was studied, with nom inal form ula M gC 1:5N ig . Light m icroscopy of polished pieces cut from the pellet showed a dense, shiny phase with < 5% porosity. Sm all regions of pure carbon (as graphite) were visible and indicated by xray analyses. Samples for magnetization and transm is sion electron m icroscopy (TEM) characterization were cut from the interior of the pellet. Scanning and transm ission electron m icroscopy, g. 1, show that the sam ples consist of colonies of ne grains. SEM analyses show colonies ranging from 1 to 10 m in size, with thin regions of carbon in the boundaries between colonies. TEM ana H yses show that the grain size is 100-300 nm , typical of a polycrystalline interm etallic com pound. G rain-boundary dislocations were evident along m any grain boundaries, suggesting that a substantial num ber of grains have low angles ofm isorientation to each other w ithin each colony.

E lectrom agnetic characterization was perform ed on a 3 mm 3 mm 0 .5 mm prism. A vibrating sample m agnetom eter (V SM ) was used to m easure the sam ple m om ent m (H ;T ) from 1.8 to 330 K and in a eld H

A slight bulge is evident at high eld for the 1.8 K curve,in com parison to curves at higher tem peratures. T he hysteresis loops actually close slightly below the background m agnetization, at the irreversibility eld H (T), as show n in g.2 inset. A sm all, reversible diam agnetic m agnetic m om ent (relative to the 10 K background) was visible above H , w hich changed slope to overlap the 10 K curve at the upper criticaleld H <sup>c</sup><sup>2</sup>(T).

The inset focuses on data at 4.2 K, detailing the methodologies for determining irreversibility and upper critical fields, H* and Hc2, respectively. The curves reveal the systematic shift in bulk pinning force towards higher fields at lower temperatures, indicating diverse pinning mechanisms across temperatures【4:2†temp_paper_5a449345ef59376951ad18b3dda57e79.txt】.

R educed curvesFp(h;T)=Fpm ax(h;T) plotted against a norm alized eld h = H =H (T) typically overlap w hen a single pinning m echanism and pinning center is dom inant [\[11\]](#page-4-0), and this behavior would be expected ife.g.grain boundaries alone were the pinning centers. Such scaling behavior is com m only observed in interm etalliclow -tem peraturesuperconductorssuch asN b3Sn [\[12,13,14\]](#page-4-0). By contrast,a constant shape ofthe bulk pinning-force curve is not obeyed as a function oftem perature in the present experim ent, as show n in g.[3](#page-2-0). Instead,a system atic shift ofthe reduced pinning-force curvepeak toward highereld occursasthe tem perature is reduced. T his behavior strongly suggests that dierentpinning m echanism sand pinning centersare atwork for tem peratures near to and far below Tc,respectively. It is very unlikely that pinning by grain boundaries is the dom inant pinning m echanism at 1.8 K ,because the observed grain size of 100 to 300 nm is com parable to thatseen in w idely-studied N b3Sn com posites,forw hich the peak ofFp(H ) is rarely higher than h = 0:25 [\[13\]](#page-4-0). Instead,the 1.8 K curve has the shape expected forpinning by sm allvoidsorprecipitates[\[9](#page-3-0)].A grain-boundary pinning m echanism is consistentw ith the 6.5 K curve in g.[3.](#page-2-0)

**Caption:** This high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image showcases a thin region of the sample, observed along the 301 zone axis, emphasizing the nanoparticle sizes. The inset provides a high-resolution image of the moiré fringe spacing relative to atomic rows of the MgCNi3 phase, indicating a lattice fringe separation spanning about five MgCNi3 unit cells. This figure supports the study on the size of nanoprecipitates (2-5 nm) and the cube-on-cube texture with the MgCNi3 matrix, highlighting the significance of moiré fringes in examining nanoprecipitate size and mismatches【4:1†temp_paper_5a449345ef59376951ad18b3dda57e79.txt】.

cipitates have cube-on-cube texture w ith the M gC N i3 m atrix. Since the precipitate lattice param eter is 25% larger than that ofthe m atrix,there is close to a 5-on-4 com m ensuration between the two phases. C onsistent w ith this analysis,m oirfringesdom inate high-resolution T EM im ages, such as those show n in g.6. From the fringe spacing dm f of 1.96 nm , a lattice param eter of d<sup>1</sup> = 0:47 nm can be obtained from the reciprocalrelationship dm f = d0d1(d<sup>1</sup> d0) <sup>1</sup> . T his agrees w ith the value obtained from diraction above.M ism atch strains are absentin g.6 probably due to the com m ensuration. D om ains 5 nm in size are also evident,indicating the nanoprecipitate size.

To explain the unusual
ux-pinning behavior,we note

<span id="page-3-0"></span>that the plot in g.[3](#page-2-0) is strikingly sim ilar to the behaviorreported in [9]foroptim ized N b48w t.% T istrands.In thatsystem ,strong pinning wasproduced by a very ne 2-phase nanostructure of 1 to 4 nm thick, nearly pure T iprecipitates separated by 5 to 10 nm in a m atrix of superconducting N b-T i.Since the (nonsuperconducting) precipitate thickness was not too sm allcom pared w ith the
ux-linecorediam eter2 10 nm at4.2 K ,and since there wasa highernum berofprecipitatesthan 
ux lines, the authors reasoned that individualcore-pinning interactions could be sum m ed up directly to give a pinningforce curve w ith a peak at h 0:5. H owever, since just below T<sup>c</sup> = 9:1 K the 
uxon core was m uch larger, due to the divergence of (T) / (1 T=Tc) <sup>1</sup>=<sup>2</sup> , the nanom eter-scale variations becam e invisible to the 
ux linesand largerscale variationsthen becam e the pinning sites. T his produced a pinning-force curve w ith a peak below h = 0:25 at 8.5 K .T he lack oftem perature scaling ofFp(H )in [9]thusresulted from the com bination of having nonsuperconducting regionsdistributed on a scale lessthan (0)and the diverging tem perature dependence of asT ! Tc.

In thepresentexperim ent,a sim ilardistribution ofpinning sites at length scales com parable to (0) 6 nm is present.W e surm ise,therefore,thatthe shiftofthe pinning forcecurvein g[.3](#page-2-0) istheresultof
ux pinning by the nanoprecipitatesatlow tem peratureand itsabsenceatT nearTc. G raphite is not a superconductor,w hich would give the necessary localsuppression ofsuperconductivity needed for 
ux pinning. T his is probably true for the cubic phase as well,since no secondary superconducting transitions were indicated in [1]. T he volum e fraction of pinning sites m ustalso be substantial, 20% [9],to provide a num berdensity ofpinning sitescom parableto the ux-line density. T hus,the presentexperim entindicates that there is a large fraction of precipitates present in M gC N i3,w hich should aectitsnorm al-state and superconducting properties.

In particular,we observed a large slope <sup>0</sup>dH <sup>c</sup><sup>2</sup>=dT of 1:86 T /K atTc,sim ilar to the slope found in [7]. T his indicates that M gC N i<sup>3</sup> is a dirty-lim it superconductor. W especulatethatthisisa directconsequenceoftheelectron scattering by the precipitates. M oreover,since excess C is needed to obtain high Tc,graphite precipitates m ay be an inevitable part ofthe fabrication process. It is also likely that the cubic nanoprecipitates result from the fabrication process, and m ay be found in M gC N i3 sam ples used in other experim ents so far. Ifanalogs of M gC N i<sup>3</sup> can be m ade w ith higherT<sup>c</sup> w hile retaining the nanostructure,these m ay havetechnologically im portant upper criticaleld values.

A n interesting and perhaps very im portant result is the observation ofstrong core pinning by intragranular pinning sites in a polycrystalline interm etallic superconductor. T his com bination is extrem ely rare; generally grain-boundary pinning isdom inant,and pinning by e.g. intragranularstructuraldefectsonly takesoverw hen the grain sizesisvery large[\[16](#page-4-0)]orw hen the
ux latticeisvery soft[\[17\]](#page-4-0). Further,these excellent
ux-pinning properties are found togetherw ith high H <sup>c</sup><sup>2</sup> (relative to Tc). O fall thesuperconducting m aterials,perhapsonly N b-T ialloys exhibit such a unique com bination ofpinning and high-

eld perform ance,and partly forthisreason (ductility is the other) N b-T ialloys have been the m ainstay ofm agnet technology since the 1960s. For exam ple,the standard expression H <sup>c</sup><sup>2</sup>(0) = 3110Tc[tesla][\[15](#page-4-0)] suggests upper criticaleldsof20 T atlow tem perature could be obtained ifT<sup>c</sup> were doubled in a doped com pound w ith com parableresistivity and electronicspecic heatcoef cient to thatfound in M gC N i3.T herefore,analogsof M gC N i<sup>3</sup> w hich have higherT<sup>c</sup> m ight be extrem ely valuable for m agnetapplications.

In conclusion,wehaveexam ined the
ux-pinning properties and nanostructure of M gC N i3. T he 
ux-pinning results are suggestive of a transition from pinning by grain boundariesattem peraturesnearT<sup>c</sup> to corepinning by 10 to 20% ofnanom eter-scaleprecipitatesatlow tem peratures. Transm ission electron m icroscopy indicated the presence of graphite and a cubic phase related to M gC N i3,possibly a carbon decient version ofthe sam e com pound,w ith 2 to 5 nm size and substantialvolum e fraction.Since the precipitates can form because ofprocessing w ith excess carbon and M g loss,scattering due to the nanostructure m ay be the cause ofdirty-lim itbehavior seen so far. Ifhigher criticaltem perature can be obtained in analogs ofM gC N i<sup>3</sup> w hich retain the nanostructure, these m ight exhibit technologically im portant upper criticaleld values. M oreover,M gC N i<sup>3</sup> exhibits the unique com bination ofhigh H <sup>c</sup><sup>2</sup> and strong core pinning by the nanostructure,w hich is not found in other interm etallic superconductors. T his m akes analogs of M gC N i3 potentially im portantfor m agnet technology.
