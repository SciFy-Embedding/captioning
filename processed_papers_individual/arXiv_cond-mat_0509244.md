## A bstract

The investigation of the tem perature dependences of microwave surface in pedance and com plex conductivity of V 3 Si single crystals with di erent stoichiom etry allowed to observe a number of peculiarities which are in rem arkable contradiction with single-gap Bardeen-Cooper-Schrice er theory. At the same time, they can be well described by two-band model of superconductivity, thus strongly evidencing the existence of two distinct energy gaps with zero-tem perature values

The story ofm ulti-gap superconductors goesto the m iddle ofthe lastcentury,when the extension ofBardeen-Cooper-Schrieer (BCS) theory [\[1](#page-6-0)]was proposed [\[2](#page-6-1)[,3\]](#page-6-2). The followed experim entalinvestigations,however,contradicted each othershowing theexistenceofsingle gap,m ultiple gaps and slightly anisotropic gap in various superconducting m aterials. The interest to this phenom enon hasbeen stim ulated by the discovery oftwo-gap superconductivity in M gB2.The existence ofatleasttwo dierentenergy bandscrossing the Ferm i-level (particular feature ofM gB2) appears to be the prerequisite for the observation ofm ultiple gaps. The second requirem ent, as follows from [\[3\]](#page-6-2),is a weak interband scattering. Such processes can be signicantly reduced ifwave functions ofelectrons from two bands have dierent sym m etry. For exam ple this m ay happen when energy band structure has both at and nonat areas near the Ferm ilevel. Flat areas lead to a singularity in the density ofstates at the Ferm ileveland can be experim entally detected for instance by non-linear tem perature dependence ofthe resistivity (T)in the norm alstate.In the opposite case of m oreorlesssim ilarbandsstructureseven sm allam ountofim puritiesleadsto high interband scattering and alm ostexcludes the possibility to detectm ulti-gap response ofthe m aterial.

A pparently,the above requirem ents apply to the layered superconductor N bSe<sup>2</sup> and to A 15 structure superconductors N b3Sn,V3Si,V3G a,in which the density ofstates has very high and narrow peak just in the vicinity of the Ferm ilevelaccording to band-structure calculations [\[4\]](#page-6-3). R ecently the existence ofm ultiple gaps in N b3Sn polycrystalline sam ple hasbeen proposed to explain specic heatm easurem ents[\[5](#page-6-4)].The authorsof[\[6\]](#page-6-5)showed the sim ilarity ofthem agneticeld dependenceoftherm alconductivity in N bSe<sup>2</sup> to thatofM gB<sup>2</sup> and concluded aboutthe presence ofthe second energy gap in NbSe2.Such a sim ilarity was notfound in V3Si. H owever,back in 1969 J.Brock denoted the existence ofthe second gap asone ofthe possible explanationsofthe peculiarities seen in the specic heatofV3Si[\[7\]](#page-6-6).

The m easurem ents ofthe tem perature dependences ofm icrowave conductivity both in low-T<sup>c</sup> and high-T<sup>c</sup> superconductorswere very inform ative.They proved the applicability of BCS theory to conventionalsuperconductors,allowed to distinguish superconductors with dierent order param eter sym m etry and to m easure the values ofenergy gap,penetration depth,quasiparticles relaxation rate,m ean free path,that are the quantities im portant for com parison with rst-principles calculations. In the c-axis oriented M gB<sup>2</sup> lm s an anom alous peak in the realpartofconductivity around T=T<sup>c</sup> = 0:6 was observed [\[8\]](#page-6-7). Its origin is associated with the sm allness ofthe gap in a dirty two gap superconductor. H owever,up

to now there was no successful preparation of M qB2 sam ples series with di erent in purity concentration and falling into dirty and pure limit. A 15 m aterials which preparation technology is well established seem to be the best candidates for the detailed study of two-gap superconductivity.

In this Letter we present investigation of the temperature dependences of microwave surface im pedance Z (T ) = R (T )+ iX (T ) and com plex conductivity (T ) = V 3,5 i crystals with di erent degree of im perfection and critical tem peratures. The activation energy 2 of low -tem perature dependences X that ism uch sm aller than BC S value (0) = 1:76T . . The so-called coherent peak appearing in 0:35T. The curve of (T) in the clean sample has no peak at all. The dependences ®(T) of both sam ples dem onstrate an evident in ection at tem perature T peculiarities are in rem arkable contractiction with single-band BCS m odel but can be well tted by two-band m odel of superconductivity thus evidencing the existence of two distinct

energy gaps with zerotem perature values

Two single crystals of V 3Siwere investigated. Sample # 1 had stoimiom etric com position, that is 25% of silicon, whereas # 2 was prepared with 1% of silicon de ciency. Both sam ples having rectangular shape were prelim inary polished and cleaned to rem ove possible surface contam ination . M easurem ents of the ac-susceptibility at 100 kH z superconducting transition tem peratures T. = 16.5 K and T. = 12.5 K for sam ples # 1 and # 2, respectively, and the transitions widths less than 0.2 K .

The microwave experiments were perform ed by the "hot- nger" technique [9, 10]. W e placed the sample into the center of the cylindrical superconducting nicbium cavity resonating at the frequency f = != = 9;4 G H z in TE 011 m ode and having high unloaded quality factor Q o ' 2 . Since the sample is located at the antinode of the m icrow ave m agnetic eld, the resonance frequency f (T ) of the system and its quality factor Q (T ) can be easily related to the surface in pedance Z (T ) = R (T ) + iX (T ) of the sam ple using sim ple form ulas [10]. The realpart, surface resistance R (T ), is proportionalto the m icrow ave power absorbed by the sample, whereas the im aginary part, surface reactance X (T ), is the reactive com ponent which de nes the electrom agnetic eld screening. In the superconducting state when R (T ) (T)= X (T)=! o where o = 4 = 10 7 H /m . Them ain three advantages of this technique are (i) the sensitivity in the superconducting state of even sm all crystal being high enough to detect the change in (I ) am ounting to parts of a nanom eter, (ii) the possibility to obtain the value of (0) and to measure (iii) the norm al state conductivity.

The results of the surface in pedance m easurem ents in the tem perature range 2 T 100 K are shown in Fig. 1. In the norm al state the data on both samples dem onstrate the equality R (T ) = X (T ) from T ' 35 K and up to 300 K thus conform ing the validity of the nom alskin e ect. Thism akespossible to obtain the resistivities (T) = 2R 2 (T )=! o show n in the inset to Fig. 1. Nonlinear tem perature dependence of (T) in the entire tem perature range points to a singularity in the density of states in V 31. Low value of the resist.inty (I'c) ' 2 sam ple # 2 show s 20 tim es higher resistivity (Tc).

A quasiparticle relaxation time near the transition tem perature can be estim ated from the standard formula of the Gorter and Casim ir two- uid m odel ! To) = X 2 (0)=2R 2 (1) : ! (1) / 0.06 and 0.006 for samples # 1 and # 2, respectively. Rather large value of in the sam ple # 1 leads to the non-zero value of the in aginary part of the nom alstate conductivity (time dispersion of the D nude conductivity) and causes the discrepancy between R (I ) and X (T) curves in Fig. 1 at 17 < T < 35 K .W e qet param eter = 1= (T .) : # 1 and superconducting gaps using BCS relation (0) = 1:76T {. W e have (0) ' 30 K for sam ple # 1 and (0) ' 20 K for sample # 2. Combining the above obtained values we conclude that sample # 1 can be classi ed as clean superconductor ( > ), w hereas sam ple # 2 falls into the dirty lim it ( < ).

In Fig. 2 the dependences of h [X (T ) | X (0)] on T =T are shown. Since in the London superconductor [K (T ) X (0)] / exp[ (0)=I ], the sbpes of the linear at T < [=3 sections of these graphs (solid lines in Fig. 2) directly give us the values 2 (0)=T = 0 :97 and 2 (0)=T = 0.93 for samples # 1 and # 2, respectively. These values are approxim attely half in comparison with the standard BCS value.

In the superconducting state we nd the values of zero-tem perature penetration depth (0) = X (0)=! o being equal150 nm and 180 nm for sam ples # 1 and # 2 , respectively. V ,Si can be classi ed as London superconductor in which the coherence length (0) = 5 nm [] at T = 0 is m uch less than the m agnetic eld penetration depth . So, the relationship between the in pedance and complex conductivity is given by local form ula == i! = i!

obtain the tem perature dependences of com plex conductivity we use the values X = X (T ) and R = R (T ) Rees where R (T ) and X (T ) are shown in F ig. 1 and R res = R (T . 0) is so-called residual surface resistance [11]. Below 4 K surface resistance curves of both sam ples rich the plateau which enables us to determ ine Rreg values am ounting to 1 :7 0 0 02 m and 0:24 m in samples # 1 and # 2, respectively. The account for Rres does not change 0 (T) but in uences (T).

The in ection seen in X (T ) curve in Fig. 1 at T = 10 K for the sample # 1 becom es m ore evident when looking at the im aginary part 10 (T) of the conductivity shown in Fig. 3. M oreover, quite sim ilar in ection persists also in the second sam ple. No such an in ection is predicted by the single qap BCS m odel (dashed and dotted lines in Fig. 3) . The accuracy of our method (less than 1 nm for (T)) and the fact that we directly extract the absolute value (0) of the penetration depth suggest that the peouliarities of caused by an experim ental extor. For the sake of com parison in the sam e gure we show also our m easurem ents of the conductivity (T) of P b2 xM 0gSg crystal (Chevrel phase) which is well tted by BCS theory.

Fig. 4 dem onstrates the tem perature dependences of the real part of the conductivity 0 (T). It is well known that in the dirty limit of BCS model there is a pronounced coherence peak in which happens at T 0:35 T. The dotted line in Fig. 4 shows superconductor with T 。 = 12:5 K . However, dirty sample # 2 has a broad peak centered at T 0 5 T. Its position is only slightly a ested by the choice of R res, and by no m eans can be shifted to the BCS value. The curve of T) in sample # 1 has no peak because the coherence peak disappears in the clean lim it of the B C S m odel (dashed line in F ig. 4),

The peculiarities of (T ) curves in Figs. 3 and 4 can be explained in the fram ework of sim pli ed two-band model with free param eters of intraband (g11 and 922) and interband coupling (G12 and 921, chosen to be equal for sin plicity). In the model [2, 3] the values of superconducting gaps in two bands can be obtained from the follow ing set of equations:

$$\mathbf{T}\begin{array}{c} \mathbf{T}\_{1} = \mathbf{q}\_{11} \ \_{1}\mathbf{T}\{\\_1\} + \mathbf{q}\_{12} \ \_{2}\mathbf{T}\{\\_2\};\\ \mathbf{T}\{\\_1\} = \mathbf{T} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{T} \\ \end{array} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{T}\{\\_2\};\\ \mathbf{T} = \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{T} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{T}\{\\_1\} + \mathbf{q}\_{22} \ \_2\mathbf{T}\{\\_2\} \end{array} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{T}\{\\_2\} \\ \end{array} \\ \mathbf{T}\{\\_1\} = \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{T} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{T} \{\\_1\} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{T} \{\\_2\} \end{array} \mathbf{T}\{\\_2\} \end{array}$$

U sing the obtained gapsvalueswe can calculate the tem perature dependencesofconductivities <sup>j</sup>(T)= <sup>0</sup> <sup>j</sup>(T) i<sup>00</sup> <sup>j</sup>(T)in each band (j= 1;2)using the following generalization of form ulas[\[12\]](#page-7-3):

$$\begin{aligned} \text{tfjj} &= \frac{\text{tf}}{\text{f}} \text{ tf} \quad \text{tf} \quad \text{(2)}\\ \text{tfjj} &= \frac{\text{g} + 1}{\text{u}} + \frac{\text{g} - 1}{\text{u}} \\ \text{tfjj} &= \frac{\text{g} + 1}{\text{u}} + \frac{\text{g} - 1}{\text{u}} \end{aligned} \quad \text{f} \quad \text{f} \quad \begin{aligned} \text{f} &= \text{g} \\ \text{f} &= \text{g} \\ \text{f} &= \text{g} \end{aligned} \quad \text{f} \quad \begin{aligned} \text{f} &= \text{g} \\ \text{f} &= \text{g} \\ \text{f} &= \text{g} \end{aligned} \quad \text{f} \quad \begin{aligned} \text{f} &= \text{g} \\ \text{f} &= \text{g} \\ \text{f} &= \text{g} \end{aligned}$$

$$\text{f} \quad \begin{aligned} \text{g} &= \text{g} \\ \text{g} &= \text{g} \\ \text{f} &= \text{g} \end{aligned} \quad \text{g} \quad \begin{aligned} \text{g} &= \text{g} \\ \text{g} &= \text{g} \\ \text{f} &= \text{g} \end{aligned} \quad \text{g} \quad \begin{aligned} \text{g} &= \text{g} \\ \text{g} &= \text{g} \\ \text{g} &= \text{g} \end{aligned}$$

Then,neglecting the interband im purity scattering,which is expected to be m uch weaker than intraband scattering,wegetthetotalm icrowaveconductivity asa sum ofconductivities (2) in two bands [\[13\]](#page-7-4). The in

O ne can easily see that the change ofg<sup>12</sup> for sam ples # 1 and # 2 is in a good agreem ent with the evolution of experim ental <sup>00</sup>(T) curves for these sam ples, that is, the dirtier sam ple the greaterinterband coupling.N ote also thatgap-to-T<sup>c</sup> ratiosoccurred to be alm ostthe sam e forboth sam ples,nam ely, <sup>1</sup> 1:8T<sup>c</sup> and <sup>2</sup> Tc.

In contrast to the excellentagreem entbetween the calculationsand experim entaldata on <sup>00</sup>(T)in Fig.3, only the qualitative agreem ent takes place for <sup>0</sup>(T). The possible reason ofquantitative dierence m ay be caused by the sim plication ofthe theoreticalm odelused. Forexam ple, itdoesnotaccountforthe interband scattering and strong coupling eects.

In the absence ofdetailed calculationsofV3SiFerm isurface we cannottreatthe data in

the fram ew ork of an anisotropic s-w ave m odel of superconductivity. H ow ever, the calculated tem perature dependence of NM R relaxation rate (analogue of anisotropy [14] does not show signi cant di erence from the standard BCS m odel. The appearance of the in ection on (T) in the model [14] is also quite unlike.

In conclusion, the real and in aginary parts of the microw ave conductivity were measured in two V 3Si crystals with di erent silion content, purity regim e and To values. The results obtained cannot be explained by single band BCS m odel of superconduct.inity. A t the sam e time they can be well described by two-band theory. In both sam ples the values of gap-toratios are approxim ately the same, nam ely, the large gap is is 22 This experimental evidence of two energy gaps in V3Si, which seem ed earlier to be conventional BC S-superonductor, can be con im ed also by our prelim inary m icrow ave m easurem ents of V 3S i crystals with silicon content low ered down to 20% .

**Caption:** The figure details temperature dependences of the surface resistance (squares) and reactance (circles) for samples #1 (solid symbols) and #2 (open symbols). It clearly shows how R(T) and X(T) are comparable in the normal state up to about 35 K, confirming the normal skin effect assumption. The inset expounds resistivities in the normal state, revealing notable differences between the two samples, particularly sample #2's higher resistivity. The nonlinear temperature dependence of resistivity indicates a singularity in the density of states, pertinent to the specific electronic structure of V3Si. This analysis lays groundwork in recognizing different conductive characteristics based on the sample purity and preparation, vital for understanding nuanced superconducting behaviors under various experimental configurations.

**Caption:** This figure depicts the logarithmic scale of surface reactance versus T/Tc, where T is the temperature and Tc is the critical temperature. The data shown are for two samples, #1 (blue circles) and #2 (red squares). In this plot, the slopes of the linear portions at T < Tc/3 give the values of the smaller superconducting gap Δ2(0). These slopes, reflected in the values Δ2(0)/Tc of 0.97 and 0.93 for samples #1 and #2 respectively, are significantly less than the BCS theory's standard expectation. The dashed line represents the slope expected from a single-gap BCS theory, highlighting the deviation in these two-band superconductors. The scientific significance here lies in illustrating the presence of a smaller energy gap, indicating divergence from traditional single-gap BCS superconductors, thus supporting two-gap superconductivity in V3Si samples.

**Caption:** This figure illustrates the temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the conductivity σ''(T)/σ''(0) for two V3Si samples (sample #1 shown as circles, sample #2 as squares) and a Pb2Mo6S8 crystal (shown as diamonds). Solid lines correspond to predictions from the weak-coupling two-band theory using the parameters g11, g22 listed for each sample. The dashed, dotted, and dash-dotted lines show single-band BCS theoretical predictions at different temperatures. The experimental results diverge from these single-band predictions, demonstrating qualitative agreement with the two-band theoretical model, namely at temperatures below 16 K. This supports the theory that the mechanism of superconductivity in these samples involves multiple energy bands, challenging the single-gap model employment in traditional superconductor descriptions.

Solid lines stand for the case of weak-coupling two-band theory with the param eters listed in the comer. Dashed, dotted and dash-dotted lines show single-band BCS calculations for T = 165, 12.5, and 13.6 K respectively.

**Caption:** Shown are temperature dependences of the real part of conductivity, σ′(T)/σ(T_c), for two V3Si samples (#1 in circles, #2 in squares) derived within a two-band model frame, with lines representing the theoretical fit. The data for sample #2 show a pronounced coherence peak around T~0.5T_c, explained by the two-band model, in contrast to the BCS prediction, which shows a peak at ~0.35T_c. The lack of a coherence peak in sample #1 is consistent with clean limit expectations. These results highlight deviations from single-band superconductivity behavior due to the interband scattering effects, thereby emphasizing the need for a two-band theoretical model in explaining superconducting properties of these samples.

Solid lines show the calculations in the fram ework of two-band m odel with the sam e param eters as in F ig. 3. Relaxation times used for thing are shown in the comer of the plot.

**Caption:** This plot represents the temperature dependence of the superconducting gaps Δ1 and Δ2 calculated with equation (1) for a superconductor with two critical temperatures, Tc = 16.5 K and Tc = 12.5 K. The solid and dashed lines show Δ1 and Δ2, respectively, for the higher Tc superconductor, while dotted and dash-dotted lines are for the lower Tc variant. These variations in the gap behaviors are aligned with weak-coupling two-band models rather than single-band models like BCS. The calculated variances underscore the existence of multiple gaps, a hallmark of multi-band superconductors, and consequently illustrate the insufficiency of a simplistic single-gap approach to comprehend the full complexity of superconductivity in these systems.
