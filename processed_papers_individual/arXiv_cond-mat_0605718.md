W hile the technologies for utilizing high-T<sup>c</sup> cuprates are m aking steady progress in recent years,triniobium stannide (N b3Sn) is stillone ofthe m ost im portant m aterials for the practicalapplication ofsuperconductivity after fty yearssince itsdiscover[y.](#page-4-0)<sup>1</sup> Because ofitsconvenientcharacterssuch asm odestly high transition tem perature (T<sup>c</sup> ' 18:3 K ) and rem arkably high upper critical  eld ( <sup>0</sup>H <sup>c</sup><sup>2</sup> ' 24:5 T ), N b3Sn is used at the heart of superconducting devices,m ostnotably assuperconducting w iresin high- eld m agnets.N b3Sn belongsto a class ofA3B binary interm etallic com pounds w ith the A 15 or -tungsten structure,w here those based on N b give rise to a subclassthatincludesN b3G e[2](#page-4-0),w hich used to dom inate the highestT<sup>c</sup> (' 23 K )form ore than thirty years, and therefore it was once a subject of intensive study until '70s.[3,4,5](#page-4-0) Surprisingly, however, it seem s that the m icroscopic detailson the superconducting charactersof N b3Sn arenotfully understood to date.Forexam ple,the revelation of a structuraltransform ation from cubic to tetragonalw ith decreasing tem perature notfaraboveT<sup>c</sup> (m artensitic phase transition,w hich occurs at T<sup>M</sup> = 43 K in N b3Sn[6](#page-4-0)) led to the argum ent that the coupling to the instability oflattice vibrations(softphonons)associated w ith the m artensitic transition m ight contribute to the increase ofTc.

**Caption:** Figure 15 presents muon spin rotation (SR) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments on the vortex lattice state of Nb3Sn. Panel a shows an SR time spectrum at 2 T within a rotating reference frame of 201 MHz, while panel b captures the real amplitude of the Fast Fourier Transformed (FFT) time spectra under various magnetic fields in the mixed state of Nb3Sn. These spectra, adjusted for clarity, reflect the density n(B) of internal magnetic fields. The figure sheds light on the SR's ability to detail local field distributions while the SANS captures broader lattice structures, elaborating on superconducting characteristics and transformative behaviors within magnetic fields.

ux line lattice (FLL): SR is sensitive to local  eld distribution

<span id="page-1-0"></span>while SANS is sensitive to the long range structure of FLL.Moreover, it elim inates much of the problem s associated with the di erence in the preparation of specim en . In this brief communication, we show that one of the keys to understand the superconductivity of N b3 Sn is the anisotropy in the electronic state, which is dem onstrated by the transform ation of FLL structure from hexagonal to squared with increasing ux density. Sim ilar observation in V3Sistrongly suggests that this is a comm on feature of the superconductors with A 15 structure, 9,10 w here the anisotropy of the Ferm i surface is re ected through the nonlocale ect.11/2 M eanw hile, the eld-induced enhancem ent of the m agnetic penetration depth at lower

elds, which is absent in V3Si,13 indicates the presence of low energy quasiparticle excitation due to the quasiclassicalD oppler shift.14 This result strongly suggests that the superconducting order param eter also has an an isotropic (or multi-gapped) structure on the Ferm i surface.15

N b3 Sn sam pleswere prepared by the m ethod described elsewhere.16 The superconducting transition tem perature was determ ined to be 17.9 (2) K , as inferred from the shielding e ect in m agnetization measurem ent. Several single crystals with a sizable dimension ( 10 m g each, covering a beam spot area of 7 m m2 w ith random crystal orientation) were used for SR m easurem ent with a high transverse eld spectrom eter (H iT ime) installed on the M 15 beam line of TR IU M F , C anada, w here they were irradiated by a m uon beam of 4 M eV . Further details on the SR measurem ents using H iT im e m ight be found in earlier publications.17 O ne of these crystals, which was con im ed to be of single dom ain at am bient tem perature, w as used for the neutron m easurem ents with the SAN S-J spectrom eter of JR R -3, Japan A tom ic E nergy A gency. In both measurem ents, precautions were taken to m inim ize the e ect of ux pinning: every time when external m agnetic eld was changed, the sam ple tem perature was raised above T c and cooled down again after the m agnetic eld was settled. The m agnetic eld dependence was obtained for transverse eld SR spectrum (TF - SR , where

the initialm uon spin polarization is perpendicular to the external eld) at 2.0 { 2.5 K and for SANS spectrum at 2.6 (1) K , respectively .

Since we can reasonably assume that implanted muons (with 4 MeV) stop random ly on the length scale of FLL (which is 20{200 nm over the relevant eld range), TF- SR signal provides a random sam pling of the internal eld distribution B (r), P (t) = exp( { } { } } { } { } ( } } = x ( } dB ; , w ith n ( B ) = h (B B (r))i, where p is the additional relaxation due to random ux pinning, n (B ) is the spectral density for the internal eld de ned as a spatial average (hi) of the delta finction over a unit cell of FLL, is the muon gyrom agnetic ratio (= 2 = 135:53 M Hz/T), and is the initial phase of rotation.18 These equations indicate that the realam plitude of the Fourier transform ed m uon spin precession signal corresponds to the spectral density, n (B).

**Caption:** Figure 5 displays patterns of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) diffraction obtained by subtracting background data at 30 K from data at 2.6(1) K after field cooling under various external magnetic fields (1 T to 4 T). Panel a corresponds to 1 T, b to 2 T, c to 3 T, and d to 4 T. The diffraction patterns reveal transitions in the FLL structure, from a potentially distorted hexagon to a more square lattice at higher fields, showing distinct changes around 2 - 3 T. These findings are related to the field-induced transformations in the vortex lattice configurations between triangular and square arrangements, providing key insights into the anisotropic properties in Nb3Sn, starkly contrasting behaviors found in other materials like V3Si.

The crystal c-axis is aligned to neutron beam , and one of the f1,0,0g in-plane axis is aligned to the horizontal axis in the plane perpendicular to the eld.

external elds ( oH H c2 )19, B (r) is given by a sum of the m agnetic induction from isolated vortices to yield

$$\mathbb{E}\_{\mathbb{K}}(\mathbf{r}) = \int\_{\mathbb{K}} \mathbb{E}(\mathbb{K}) \exp\left(-i\mathbb{K} - \mathbf{r}\right) \tag{1}$$

$$\text{Exp}(\mathbb{K}) = \mathbb{E}\_0 \frac{\exp\left(-\mathbb{K}^2 \mathbb{Z}\_{\mathbb{Q}}\right)}{\mathbb{E} + \mathbb{K}^2 \mathbb{Z}\_{\mathbb{Q}}\mathbb{Z}\_{\mathbb{Q}}\mathbb{K}^4 + \overline{\text{cl}} \mathbb{K}^2 \mathbb{Z}\_{\mathbb{Q}}\mathbb{Z}\_{\mathbb{Q}}\mathbb{Z}\_{\mathbb{Q}}}; \text{ (\mathbb{Z}\text{)}$$

where K are the vortex reciprocal lattice vectors, B o (" 0H ) is the average internal eld, is the e ective London penetration depth, , is the cuto param eter for the m agnetic eld distribution near the vortex cores, and nxxyy and d are dim ensionless param eters arising from the nonlocal corrections with the term proportional to K දිK ද controlling the fourfold anisotropy: the overline denotes an averaging of the param eter over the polar angle of the symm etry axis, as it is anticipated for a m osaic of crystals.11 It is evident in Eq.(1) that b(K ) is a spatial Fourier com ponent of B (r). The m odel predicts an asym m etric eld pro le for n (B ) characterized by a negatively shifted sharp cusp due to the van H ove singularity associated with the saddle points of B (r) and an asym ptotic tail tow ards higher elds where the m axim al eld is determ ined by B (j = rj (with ri being the vortex centers) .

Exam ples of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of SR spectra at several external m agnetic elds are show n in Fig. 1, where one can readily observe the asym metric <span id="page-2-0"></span>lineshape w ith slight sm earing due to the random pinning of vortices, random local  elds from nuclear m om ents, and the lim ited tim e w indow for FFT ( 4 s: note that such sm earing is irrelevant for the analysis in tim e dom ain). Based on the least-square m ethod w ith appropriate consideration of the statisticaluncertainty, the SR spectra arecom pared in tim edom ain w ith those calculated by using Eqs.[\(1\)](#page-1-0){[\(2](#page-1-0))to deducea setofparam eters, <sup>p</sup>, , <sup>v</sup>,nxxyy,and d:a typicalexam ple isshow n in Fig. [1](#page-0-0). For the reconstruction of B (r) from n(B ), one needsto know the two-dim ensionalstructure ofFLL obtained from other experim ental techniques including SA N S.In particular,it is noticeable in Fig.[1](#page-0-0) that the peak due to the saddle points exhibits a steep change w ith increasing external eld from 2 T to 3 T ,suggesting an anom aly in the FLL structure. A s show n below ,this speculation iscon rm ed by SA N S m easurem entsoverthe region ofrelevantm agnetic  eld.

T he cryostat (including the m agnet)and specim en are rotated slightly ( 0:2,in severalsteps)around the verticalaxisto obtain a sum of di raction patterns over Bragg angles for both triangular and square FLL structure. It is clear in Fig.[2](#page-1-0) that there is a di erence in the pattern of angles between data at 1{2 T and those at 3{4 T . Since the patterns at lower  elds suggests an overlap oftwo (possibly distorted) hexagonaldom ains due to the tetragonalcrystal structure,theirchange into the nearly four-fold sym m etric pattern at higher  elds dem onstrate the occurrence oftriangular-to-square lattice transform ation at 2{3 T .

**Caption:** Figure 3 shows the spectral density distribution n(B) calculated for a hexagonal flux line lattice (FLL) with (d = 0.004) and without (d = 0) non-local corrections under external fields at different intensities: 0.5 T and 4 T. The horizontal axis represents the magnetic field B minus the external field µ0H in mT, while the vertical axis plots the spectral density n(B). The sharp peaks in the graph correspond to the van Hove singularities owing to the turning points in B(r), where r represents the gradient in magnetic field distribution. An additional peak indicated by an arrow appears in the presence of non-local correction due to the incommensurability between the triangular FLL and the squared shape of B(r) around a vortex. These observations are significant as they imply the influence of non-local effects and anisotropies in superconductors, particularly pointing to a deviation in local vortex lattice environments compared to an ideal model.


FIG . 3: Spectral density distribution n(B ) calculated for a hexagonalFLL w ith (d = 0:004) orw ithout (d = 0)non-local correction under an external eld of 0.5 T (w here = 83:5 nm , <sup>v</sup> = 3:1 nm ,and nxxyy = 0). T he sharp peaks are due to van H ove singularities arising from turning points in B (r), w herer<sup>~</sup> <sup>B</sup> (r)= <sup>0</sup>. A n additionalpeak (labeled by arrow )appears for the form er case because ofthe incom m ensurability between triangular FLL and squared shape ofB (r) around a vortex. T hose fora square FLL at4 T are show n forcom parison ( = 100:0 nm , <sup>v</sup> = 2:8 nm ,and nxxyy = 0).

O nce the FLL structure isresolved by SA N S m easurem ents,high quality SR spectra can provide rich inform ation on the m ixed state though the detailed m apping of B (r); as it has been dem onstrated in the earlier works[13,21](#page-4-0),the lineshape strongly depends on , <sup>v</sup>, nxxyy and d in Eq.[\(2\)](#page-1-0) and thereby they can be deduced by  tting analysis w ithout m uch am biguity. In particular,as show n in Fig.3,the spectralweightfor the lower  eld side of the van H ove singularity strongly depends on the m agnitude ofd forthe squareFLL.Besidesthese, we need to introduce two m ore param eters to describe thereciprocalvectorsw hich undergo transform ation:the apex angle, ,and the m ean w idth for the FLL distortion, <sup>K</sup> , [22](#page-4-0) to describe the 
uctuation ofthe reciprocal vectors,K = l(1+ <sup>l</sup>)u + m (1+ <sup>m</sup> )v w ith a probability distribution function,P ( <sup>k</sup>)/ exp( <sup>2</sup> k=<sup>2</sup> <sup>K</sup> ) (k = l;m ). T helastparam etere ectively servesto add a Lorentziantypebroadening ton(B )and thereby discerniblefrom the G aussian broadening due to localdisorder (w hich is described by <sup>p</sup>). T he random nessassociated w ith the m osaic crystalsispresum ed to be represented by <sup>K</sup> .Fig[.4](#page-3-0) show s the  eld dependence of those param eters,w here (a) ,(b) <sup>v</sup>,(e)nxxyy and d aredirectly related w ith the localstructure ofsupercurrent around a single 
ux line, w hereasothersare w ith the m orphology ofthe FLL.Itis inferred from the behavior of <sup>K</sup> (Fig.[4](#page-3-0)c) that a strong long-range distortion occurs over a  eld range of2{4 T , w here the FLL structure undergoes transform ation between triangular and square lattice. T he anom alous enhancem entof observed in Fig[.4](#page-3-0)a isprobably dueto the artifact associated w ith this distortion;the reduced chisquareexceeds1.5 around 3 T w hileitistypically 1.2{1.4 for <sup>0</sup>H < 2 T or <sup>0</sup>H > 4 T (see Fig.[4f](#page-3-0)). Sim ilar scat<span id="page-3-0"></span>tering of the param eter value is also noticeable in v p and d over the relevant eld range, which m ay represent the system atic uncertainty due to the distortion. How ever, except for these anom alies, we can observe a clear trend in all of the param eters. N am ely, exhibits a gradual increase with increasing magnetic eld below 2 T (which wediscuss below in m ore detail), while y tends to decrease slightly at low er elds and levels o above 2 T The behavior of of the e ective vortex core radius, is commonly found in various superconductors, which is attributed to the stronger overlapping of supercurrents around vortex center and intervortex transfer of quasiparticles.23 The m agnitude of , at lower eld is in good agreem ent with the G inzburg-Landau coherence length, GL ' 39 A deduced from the relation H c2 = 0 =2 2 =2 ] [w ith H c2 (2 K ) being assum ed to be 22 T ]. A s is anticipated from the SAN S result, exhibits a steep change from 60 to 90 around 2{3 T . The behavior is qualitatively in good agreem ent with the prediction of the non-local model (solid curve11,12 , where the critical eld is assum ed to be 3 T ). Thus, it indicates that the anisotropic ow of the supercurrent due to the nonlocal e ect is the prim ary origin of the square-lattice form ation at higher elds. The m agnitude of d (" 4 10 3), which should be regarded as a lower boundary considering the fact that it is reduced by an averaging over a varying symmetry axis,11 is considerably largerthan that observed in V3Si (" 0:3{1 10 3 ),13 suggesting a stronger anisotropy in the Ferm i surface. The spin relaxation due to the random local distortion ( o) exhibits a gradual decrease with increasing eld : this is qualitatively understood as a result of stronger overlap of ux lines at higher eld that makes less room for ux lines to deviate aw ay from the regular position . Unfortunately, the SAN S data are available only up to 5 T due to experim ental conditions, and therefore the origin of the weak anom aly around 5.5 T (see Fig. 4c) is not identil ed at this stage.

It is Interesting to note that the anisotropy param eter d is sharply reduced to zero below 2 T : a sim ilar behavior is reported for V3Si.13 As shown in Fig. 4f, a com parative analysis w ith d xed to 0.004 ( an average for oH > 2 T) yields system atic increase of chi-squares, while little variation is found for other param eters. This is attributed to an additional cusp in n (B ) (see Fig. 3) corresponding to the saddle points relatively near the vortex cores where B (r) is in uenced by the squared shape of supercurrent ow . O ur result indicates that the eld pro le over the eld range of hexagonalFLL m ay be better described by the isotropic London m odel.

Now , we discuss the origin of gradual increase of in Fig. 4a. O ur system atic study on the m agnetic eld dependence of in various superconductors indicates that the gradient (d =dH ) provides inform ation on the low energy quasiparticle excitations.15 In the m ixed state, the quasiparticle momentum ve is shifted by the ow of supercurrent v 。 around the vortices due to a sem i-classical D oppler shift, leading to a shift of the quasiparticle en-

Panels a to e plot the effective London penetration depth (λ), cutoff parameter (ξ), enhanced relaxation rate due to local disorder of FLL (σ_l), apex angle of the rhombic unit cell, and dimensionless parameters describing supercurrent anisotropy (ρ_xy, d), respectively.

The figure signifies the observation of anisotropy in the superconducting state's magnetic response, underscoring superconducting features such as non-local effects, and providing evidence for anisotropic or multigapped s-wave pairing in Nb3Sn.

In sum m ary, we have obtained detailed m apping of the local m agnetic eld in the mixed state of N by Sn using SR and SANS, from which we extracted fundam ental length scales of superconductivity. Unlike V3Si, the eldinduced enhancem ent of the e ective penetration depth strongly suggests that the order param eter in N b3 Sn has a structure, either anisotropic or multi-gapped.

We would like to thank the sta of TRIUM F for their technical support during the SR experim ent.
