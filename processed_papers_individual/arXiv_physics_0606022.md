#### A bstract

T heILC baselineconsistsoftwo interaction regions,onew ith a 20m rad crossing angle and the other w ith a 2m rad crossing angle. It is know n that the outgoing beam losses in the naldoublet and subsequent extraction line are larger in the 2m rad than in the 20m rad layout. In this work, we exploit N bT iand N b3Sn superconducting m agnet technologies to redesign and optim ise the naldoublet, w ith the aim of providing satisfactory outgoing disrupted beam power losses in this region. W e present three new naldoublet layouts,specically optim ised for the 500 G eV and the 1 TeV m achines.

Thecurrentbaselineconguration oftheInternationalLinearCollider[\[1\]](#page-12-0)consistsoftwo interaction regions (IR s) and two detectors,with one IR having a large beam crossing angle and one having a sm allbeam crossing angle. The large crossing angle layout has an angle of 20m rad between the beam s, and is derived from the large crossing angle design ofthe N ext Linear Collider [\[2\]](#page-13-0). Its opticalproperties are wellunderstood,and the extraction line successfully transports the disrupted beam to the dum p,for a wide range of proposed beam param eter sets [\[3\]](#page-13-1). Furtherm ore, the design includes downstream diagnostics for energy and polarisation m easurem ent. The 2m rad interaction region layoutpresentsm ore technicalchallenges,m ainly resulting from transporting the outgoing disrupted beam o-axis in the naldoublet. This design is m ore recent and therstcom pleteopticswaspresented atSnowm ass2005 [\[4\]](#page-13-2).Thislayoutwasdeveloped for1 TeV using N bTisuperconducting naldoubletm agnetsand included downstream energy and polarim etry m easurem ent chicanes.

The current ILC param eter space is docum ented in [\[5\]](#page-13-3)and the key param eters are listed in Table [1.](#page-2-0) These consist ofsets ofrepresentative beam param eters,designed to assure 
exibility in case of unexpected practicallim itations in achieving som e of the m achine goals. The m ost challenging of these sets is known as the H igh Lum inosity set, which aim s to m axim ise the instantaneous lum inosity by m ore strongly focusing the beam s at the IP,thereby signicantly enhancing disruption eects. A necessary criterion forthe perform ance ofthe extraction line design isitsability to accom m odate thebroadestpossiblerangeofbeam param eters.The20m rad schem eissuccessfulforthe m ajority ofparam etersets,butthe current(baseline)2m rad design showsunacceptable beam power loss,both in the naldoublet and in the extraction line,for som e ofthe beam param etersconsidered.

In thiswork,we exploitthe lim itsofcurrentm agnettechnology aswellastechnology stillunder developm ent to optim ise the 2m rad naldoublet layout. W e present three new naldoublet designs,one optim ised for the baseline energy of500 G eV and two for the upgrade energy of1 TeV .W e optim ise the m agnet param eters with respect to powerdeposition from charged beam and radiative Bhabha particle losses,with thegoal ofaccom m odating allILC beam param eter sets. W e nd that this is possible by using N bTitechnology forthe 500 G eV m achine,and by using new N b3Sn technology forthe 1 TeV upgrade. H owever,an increase in pole tip eld,som ewhat beyond the currently planned lim its for N b3Sn technology,would be required to achieve power losses sm all enough to avoid quenching ofthe naldoublet m agnets for the case ofthe Low Power and H igh Lum inosity beam param eters at 1 TeV .W e include a fullset ofm agnet and opticalparam etersforevaluation by m agnetdesigners.

The beam transport and resulting losses with our new doublets are presented in Section [4,](#page-6-0) and we draw our conclusions in Section [5.](#page-11-0) W e nd that the proposed new nal doublet layouts have considerably betterbeam transportpropertiesthan the current ones.

#### 2.1 Current baseline design

EU RO TeV -R eport-2006-022

The nal doublet in the 2m rad schem e is based a superconductive large bore Q D 0 m agnet and on a norm alconducting sm aller aperture Q F1 m agnet. The two nearby sextupoles for local chrom aticity correction, SD 0 and SF1, are also superconductive large bore m agnets. In the current design, the choice of superconductive technology for Q D 0 is N bTiand the m axim um pole tip eld which is assum ed to be achievable is 5.6 T.In this work we always take l to be 4.5m and the Q D -Q F distance to be 9m . The outgoing beam passes through the coilpocket ofQ F1,where the eld is m odelled by a standard m ultipole expansion. The outer coilradius,which is available for beam passage,is115m m .In thisdesign,the doubletwasoptim ised forthe TeV m achine,and the 500 G eV layout wasobtained by scaling down the elds.

#### 2.2 M axim um pole tip eld for N bT i

Forthe N bTim agnets[\[6\]](#page-13-4)considered in thiswork,we assum e a m axim um pole tip eld of 6.28 T. This is around the m axim um eld that current coil designs can produce, and includes the eld-reducing eects ofthe externalsolenoid and a safety m agin [\[7\]](#page-13-5). Thiscorrespondsto a gradientof180 T m <sup>1</sup> in a m agnetofradialaperture 35m m .The sextupolesarerequired to belargeboresuperconducting m agnets,to allow thetransport ofthe outgoing beam .W e follow the technology choice ofthe currentdesign,and adopt a m axim um eld of4.04T in SD 0 and SF1 (with radialaperturesof88m m and 112m m , respectively)<sup>1</sup>.

tim escales ofthe ILC TeV upgrade,should hopefully be readily available<sup>2</sup>. O fcourse, such an upgrade would require replacing the naldoublet,but this is rather m inor on the scale of the 1 TeV energy upgrade. Furtherm ore the geom etry of the extraction line would need to be m aintained.The m axim um pole tip eld which we assum e willbe achievablewith N b3Sn is8.8T (taking into accountthepresenceofa solenoid background eld).This corresponds to a 250 T m 1 gradientfora 35m m radialaperture.

In thiswork,weproposethree new doubletlayouts.W eshalloptim ise thelayoutforthe 500 G eV m achine,using N bTiforQ D 0 ata m axim um poletip eld of6.28 T.Thebeam transport properties ofsuch a layout willbe considerably better that the scaled down version ofthe 1 TeV existing baseline,because the m agnet length can be reduced. The sextupoles shallbe optim ised versions ofthe current baseline. W e shallthen calculate the layoutsforthe TeV m achine,rstly using N bTiforQ D 0 asthe design for500 G eV , and secondly with N b3Sn. The resulting doublets are intended to replace the present design.

Superconductive m agnetswillquench iftoo m uch beam powerisdeposited in them ,and both integrated powerand localised powerdensity toleranceshave been specied by the CER N group for the LH C quadrupoles used in this work. The m axim um integrated power which can be tolerated per unit length is in the range 5-10 W m <sup>1</sup> . H owever, fora few specic m agnetslike those in the naldoublet,thistolerance can presum ably be relaxed a bit if m ore cryogenic power can be used. The highest localised power density which can be accepted is 0.5 m W g <sup>1</sup> . This tolerance is im portant to consider in this work because the outgoing beam is transported o-axis through severalofthe

naldoublet m agnets,and so particles at the lower end ofthe energy distribution can getover-focused onto the edge ofthe m agnetaperture on one side.Since these particles are essentially concentrated in a plane (except for their verticalangular spread), the localpower density can becom e high. W e rely on detailed com putations perform ed at R H U L with the G EA N T-4 based BD SIM sim ulation [\[8\]](#page-13-6),following sim ilar calculations atSLAC [\[9\]](#page-13-7).These calculationshave shown thatforabout1 W incidentbeam poweron the edge ofQ D 0,a m axim um power density ofabout 4 m W g <sup>1</sup> can be reached inside the N bTicoils. Ifa 3 m m Tungsten liner (corresponding to about 1 radiation length) isused to thicken the beam pipe and spread outthe showers atthe location ofthe loss, the m axim um power density can be brought down to about 0.3 m W g <sup>1</sup> in the sam e conditions. Based on these num bers,we use 1 W as the m axim um value for the power deposited on the edge ofQ D 0. This 1 W \$ 0.3 m W g <sup>1</sup> equivalence,found between totalincidentpowerand powerdensity in Q D 0,willhaveto bechecked forotherm agnet congurationsand beam param eters,especially in the case ofthe sextupoles.

In this section,we shalldiscuss our optim isation ofthe naldoublet layout. W e shall start with the optim isation ofQ D 0. Severalstudies ofthe power deposition into Q D 0 have shown thatthe charged beam lossand the lossfrom radiative Bhabhasexceed the quench lim itsofthecoils,forsom eoftheproposed beam param eters.Therefore,thegoal ofouroptim isation isto reducetheselossesto acceptablelevels,forallbeam param eters. N ote that we work in term s of total incident power, and consider the conversion to localised losses separately (see Section [2.5\)](#page-3-1). The optim isation procedure described in the following isapplied to allthree naldoublet designs outlined in Section [2.](#page-2-1)

Theunderlaying principle is,in therstinstance,to m akethem agnetasshortaspossible within the constraintsofthe available pole tip eld.H ence we begin by increasing the eld ofQ D 0 to the m axim um possible value,and decrease the length in proportion.

W e then perform a scan ofthe aperture and pole tip eld,adjusting the length to m aintain the overallfocusing strength,and using the totalpower deposition from the dierent beam param eter sets as gure ofm erit. The m agnitude ofthe beam strahlung

energy lossforthe Low Powerand H igh Lum inosity beam param etersitsuch thatthese sets dom inate the optim isation. Both the eects from the charged beam ,for vertical osetsatthe interaction pointm axim ising the beam strahlung losses,and the com bined eects ofradiative Bhabhas and the charged beam (collided in this case without a signicantverticaloset)are considered. W e generally nd a m im im um in the totalpower deposition which is very sim ilar for allparam eters sets, as the dependance ofthe totalpower versus aperture and length found from the scanning is rather shallow. This procedure allows a power-optim ised Q D 0 length,aperture and pole tip eld,with the constraints ofm aintaining the constant integrated focusing strength needed to achieve the required dem agnication and keeping the pole tip below a given assum ption on the m axim um value achievable. N ote that the form er constraint m aintains the dem agni-

EU RO TeV -R eport-2006-022

cation ofthe naltelescope,and also m aintains the integrated strength ofQ F1. To ensure that the m im im um we reach in the 3-dim ensinalspace ofthe scan is a true and globalm inim um ,we begin with a variety ofinitialm agnetconditions (i.e.origin in our space).W e nd thatwe alwaysconverge to the sam e pointin allcases.W e perform this optim isation forthe three cases we considerin thiswork and the resultisa setofthree Q D 0-Q F1 system s.

O nce Q D 0 has been optim ised,we can t for the localchrom aticity correction sextupoles. For these sextupoles, located in the im m ediate vicinity of the naldoublet quadrupoles, we assum e the sam e m axim um pole tip elds as in the baseline. The chrom aticity is corrected,and the required sextupole strengths calculated,by using a sim plied m odelofthe system ,consisting ofthe naldoubletregion and two upstream bends to generate the required dispersion. The bend strengths are tted to give <sup>x</sup> = 0 and <sup>0</sup> <sup>x</sup> = 10m rad atthe interaction point.N ote thatthe lattervalue ischosen to give acceptable sextupole strengths,whilst m aintaining the beam angular divergence close to its intrinsic value. W hile a fulltreatm ent ofthe nalfocus chrom aticity correction includes the condition ofzeroing the T<sup>126</sup> and T<sup>346</sup> m atrix elem ent across the fullsystem ,it has been shown that,to a good approxim ation,sextupole strengths consistent with those in such a fulltreatm ent can be obtained by zeroing the T<sup>166</sup> and T<sup>346</sup> m atrix elem ents across the sim plied system [\[10\]](#page-13-8). W e apply such a procedure to com pute the sextupole strengths in this work. The inter-m agnet distances chosen are shown in Table [4.](#page-6-1)In this work,the opticscode M A D [\[11\]](#page-13-9)wasused to com pute the chrom aticity correction.

The length ofthe optim ised sextupoleswaschosen to give a reasonable starting point forthebeam transport.Thesextupolelengthsarehencenotfully optim ised,and require som e further study. To optim ise the sextupole apertures,a tis perform ed,within the m axim alvalue assum ed forthe pole tip elds,and requiring no loss when transporting a N om inal,Low Power or H igh Lum inosity beam . The inter-m agnet spacings were optim ised forbeam transport.The technologicalconstraintslim itthe m axim um aperture, and we tthe aperture by requiring no losswhen transporting a nom inal,low poweror high lum inosity beam .Theavailableapertureiscom puted from thequadraticriseofthe

ofthe H igh Lum inosity oset beam s,and results in large sextupole apertures. These could be considerably reduced by relaxing the beam transportrequirem ent,forinstance ifone would avoid beam param eteroptim isationswith very large beam strahlung energy losses.

Such osets, typically ofabout a hundred m icrons,are expected in the course oftuning the accelerator,in particular during the settling ofthe trajectory feedback system at the IP.For the norm allum inosity-producing zero oset collisions, the eect of radiative Bhabha processes is included. W e use 1.28 m illion m acroparticles to represent the disrupted charged beam . The resulting m inim um power loss is oforder 0.5 to 1 W ,which can hence be considered asthe upperbound forcaseswith zero particle loss<sup>3</sup>.The radiative Bhabha losses,on the otherhand,are notstatistics lim ited.

EU RO TeV -R eport-2006-022

In Table [8](#page-8-0) we show,for reference,the power losses forthe baseline lattice at 500 G eV . Thislatticeisobtained by scaling down the1 TeV m agnetparam eters.Tabl[e9](#page-8-1) showsthe powerlosses forthe optim ised 500 G eV N bTilattice,produced following the procedure described in Section [3](#page-4-0) and using the lim itsforthe m agnetparam eterslisted in Table [3.](#page-4-1) N otethattheouterpocketradiusofQ F1wasincreased by 1m m (from 115m m to116m m ) to accom m odate the charged beam ofthe high lum inosity param etersetwith a vertical oset.Com parison oftheperform anceofthebaseline naldoubletat500 G eV ,Table [8,](#page-8-0) with the perform ance ofthe new N bTidoublet optim ised for 500 G eV ,Table [9,](#page-8-1)shows the benet of the new naldoublet layout. The power losses for all param eter sets are greatly reduced and,following the argum ents about quenching ofsuperconducting m agnets in Section [2,](#page-2-1) the power losses should be sm all enough for successful beam transportto be achieved.

**Caption:** Figure 1 portrays the impact of magnetic gradient on power losses due to radiative Bhabha interactions for the High Luminosity beam parameter set at 500 GeV in an optimized NbTi final doublet. The plot features a solid line representing power losses using the optimized magnet and a dotted line signifying the losses with an additional 20% magnetic gradient. The x-axis indicates the magnet scale factor, while the y-axis displays power loss in watts. This figure demonstrates a notable reduction in power losses with an enhanced magnetic gradient, which is crucial to minimize the risk of quenching in superconducting magnets during particle beam transport【4:0†temp_paper_a874401bbb678191b5e62613a3ef8c88.txt】.


Figure 1 : The bene cial e ect of a 20% gradient increase, for the High Lum inosty param eter set radiative Bhabha losses. The solid line is the power losses for the N b i 500 G eV optim issd doublet described in the text, and the dotted line show s the power losses achieved if an extra 20% of m agnetic gradient becam e available.

m aximum gradient possible with this m agnet technology means that, whilst the losses are lower than the baseline design at 1 TeV , they are still too high to avoid m agnet quenching. This indicates that higher gradient m agnets are required.

Finally, Table 12 shows the power bsses in the Nb3Sn nal doublet, optim issd for 1 TeV . The higher gradients expected from using N b35n superconductive m aterial enable to signi cantly reduce the power deposition as com pared to both the baseline and optimised N bT i naldoublet designs. How ever, the losses are still in excess of the quending lim its of the m agnets. To understand what in proven ent in superconducting technology would be required, we computed how much larger the pole tip eld in QD 0 would need to be to bring the sum of the charged beam and radiative Bhabha losses to less than 1W ,

**Caption:** Figure 2 illustrates the power loss from radiative Bhabhas as a function of the QD0 aperture for the Low Power beam parameter set at 500 GeV. The plot demonstrates a shallow minimum in the power loss curve, underscoring potential advantages in reducing magnet size while maintaining effective power deposition management. The x-axis represents the aperture in meters, and the y-axis quantifies power loss in watts. Minimizing aperture may help decrease the external size of the magnets, vital for optimizing beam transport infrastructure .


<span id="page-10-0"></span>Figure 2: The power loss from the Low Power param eter set radiative Bhabhas, as a function of the QD 0 aperture. This plot shows the shallow minimum in the power loss curve, which could be used to reduce the large external size of the m agnet. Note, the dependence shown here is for the baseline doublet at 500 G eV . A similarly shallow behaviour is obtained for the other cases.

for the Low Power beam param eter set. The result was that a pole tip sed of 11T in a m agnet w ith an aperture of 35mm would be needed for the Low Power beam param eter set to be accomm odated in the naldoublet at 1 TeV . The feasibility of such large pole tip elds on the time scale of the 1 TeV energy upgrade of the ILC needs to be discussed w ith relevant superconductive m agnet experts. A ltematively, beam param eters at 1 TeV m ay be optim issd with som ewhat lower beam strahlung energy loss, including for total beam powers as low as in the present Low Power param eter set. Such sets would result in signi cantly easier nal doublet designs.

In thisnote,we have described a detailed study ofthepowerdeposition in thenaldoubletofthe ILC 2m rad crossing-angle layout,from both the disrupted charged beam and from the radiative Bhabha events. W e exploited superconductive m agnet technologies both currently available and expected to be developed through on-going R & D :N bTi and N b3Sn with m axim um pole tip elds ofrespectively 6.28 T and 8.8 T.

W e nd thatusing N bTitechnology to optim ise the 500 G eV baseline naldoubletis adequate to obtain sm allenough beam powerdepositionsin the naldoublet,provided a Tungsten liner is included in the design of the vacuum cham ber to spread out the showers and reduce the m axim um power density at the location where m ost losses are concentrated. This doublet now needs to be integrated into the nalfocus system and extraction line. W hen this willbe done,we willpropose that it becom e the baseline for the 2m rad at 500G eV ,with the assum ption that it would have to be replaced at the tim e ofthe 1 TeV energy upgrade. In allcases, the sextupole lengths, strengths and apertures are not fully optim ised. Som e m ore work is stillneeded here,in view of reducing their sizes and ease their integration with the detector. It is also necessary to include the extraction line m agnetsin a furtheroptim isation.

A naldoubletbased on N bTitechnology doesnot,on the otherhand,provide sm all enough beam powerdepositionsat1 TeV ,forseveralofthebeam param etersetsconsidered. Exploiting N b3Sn superconductive technology can however im prove the situation considerably,asthe higherexpected gradientswould allow signicantly lowerpowerde-

**Caption:** Figure 4 shows the linear optics of the optimized NbTi final doublet set for nominal parameters at 500 GeV. This graph outlines the beta function variation along the magnet position in meters. It is a critical analysis for improving beam stability and minimizing power loss during beam transportation. The performance of this optimized layout surpasses that of the existing baseline design for this energy level, indicating improved beam transport properties and reductions in power loss .

positions. The optim issd layout show s far superior power loss behavior than the current 1 TeV machine baseline nal doublet, but is still in excess of the quenching limit for the beam param eter sets with the largest beam strahlung energy loss. A 35mm QD 0 w ith a pole tip eld of around 11 T would be needed to a avoid quenching of this m agnet, in the case of the Low Power beam param eters.

W e expect further R & D in superconductive m agnet technology to enable increases in m axin um available pole tip eld in the fisture, which will ease the design of the 2m rad beam crossing angle layout. An altemative path is to constrain the optim isation of the beam param eters at 1 TeV with an upper bound on the beam strahlung energy loss. This would also be m otivated since a very large beam strahlung energy loss is undesimble for several other reasons.
