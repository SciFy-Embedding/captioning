W e present a calculation of the quasiparticle contribution to the bngitudinal them al conductivities xx (H ;T ) (perpendicular to the external eld) and zz (H ;T ) (parallel to the external eld) as well as the transverse (H all) them al conductivity xy (H ;T ) of an extrem e type-II superconductor in a high m agnetic eld (H c1 H < H c2 ) and at low tem peratures. In the lim it of frequency and tem perature approaching zero ( upon entering the superconducting state undergo a reduction from their respective nom al state values by the factor ( = ) 2, which measures the size of the Ferm i surface containing gapless quasiparticle excitations. We use our theory to num erically com pute the longitudinal trans port coe cient in borocarbide and A-15 superconductors. The agreem ent with recent experim ental data on LuN i2B2C is very good.

INTRODUCTION I.

The low-tem perature, high- eld region in the H -T phase diagram of an extreme type-II superconductor is the regime where the Landau level quantization of the electronic energies within the superconducting state is well de ned, i.e. the cyclotron energy h ! ~ > , T , where

(T;H ) is the BCS gap, T is the tem perature and

(! ) is the scattering rate due to disorder. This regim e should be contrasted with the m ore fam iliar opposite lim it of low m agnetic elds and high tem peratures where electrons occupy a huge num ber of Landau levels and where the tem perature and/or im purity scattering broaden these levels and reduce the signi cance of Landau quantization. W ith the Landau level structure firlly accounted for one discovers a qualitatively new nature of quasiparticle excitations at high elds: for elds H below but near H c2 the quasiparticle spectrum is gapless at a discrete set of points on the Ferm i surface. These gapless excitations re ect a coherent quasiparticle propagation over m any unit cells of a closely packed vortex lattice with fully overlapping vortex cores (2)3 . The presence of such low -lying excitationsm akes an sw ave, \conventional" superconductor in a high m agnetic eld som ewhat sim ilar to an anisotropic, \unconventional" superconductor with nodes in the gap . In the low tem perature and high- eld regim e how ever, the nodes in the gap reect the center-o -m ass m otion of the Cooper pairs in the m agnetic eld, in contrast to d-wave superconducting cuprates where such nodes are due to the relative orbital motion. This gapless behavior in bulk system s is found to persist to surprisingly low magnetic elds H 0:2 0:5H2. Below H the gaps start opening up in the quasiparticle spectrum and the system eventually reaches the low - eld regim e of localized states in the cores of isolated, well-separated vortices '. A t the present

tim e the strongest evidence for the quantization of quasiparticle orbits within the superconducting state com es from observations of the de Haasvan A lphen (dH vA ) oscillations in various superconducting materials". The persistence of the dH vA signal deep within the m ixed state, with the frequency of oscillations stillm aintaining the norm al state value, can be attributed to the presence of a sm all portion of the Ferm i surface containing gapless quasiparticle excitations, surrounded by regions where the gap is large 6 .

A nother useful probe of low energy excitations in superconductors ism easurem ent oftheirtherm altransport. The sim ultaneous measurem ents of the eld dependent longitudinal xx (H ;T ) and transverse xy (H ;T ) them al conductivities are now feasible experim entally and can yield inform ation on both quasiparticle dynam ics and the pairing mechanism . The dependence of transport coe cients on m agnetic eld is currently a hotly debated issue in the scienti c community in light of the experim ental observation of eld independent plateaus in the longitudinal them al conductivity of high tem perature superconductors (HTS) at low elds (H c1 < H c2 ) . The eld-independent xx is attributed to the dx2 y 2 pairing m echanism at low elds and to the nodal structure of the resulting quasiparticle excitations . The presence of propagating gapless quasiparticles in the superconducting state at low temperatures and high magnetic elds should also lead to transport properties qualitatively different from those found in s-w ave superconductors at low elds, where the num ber of them ally activated quasiparticles is exponentially sm all and the only contribution to the them al conduction is found along the eld direction and originates from the bound states within vortex cores. Recently, the them al conductivity of the borocarbide superconductor LuN ≥B2C was m easured down to T = 70 m K by Boaknin et al.10 in am agnetic eld perpendicular to the heat current from H = 0 to above H c2 = 7 Tesla.

<span id="page-1-0"></span>In the limit of T ! 0, a considerable them altransport w as observed in the mixed state of the superconductor (H c1 < H c2), indicating the presence of delocalized low energy excitations at the Ferm i surface. O n the other hand, no them al transport was observed at zero eld, a result consistent with the s-w ave superconducting gap w ithout nodes at the Ferm i surface.

The purpose of this work is to exam ine the contribution of low -energy quasiparticles to the them altransport of conventional, i.e. extrem e type-II superconductors in the regim e of high m agnetic elds and low tem peratures. The paper is organized as follow s: In Sec. II we develop the Kubo form alism for the transport coe cients w ithin the Landau levelpairing mechanism while in Sec. III we incorporate disorder in the Green's function description of a three-dim ensionalsuperconductor in a high m agnetic

eld. We use the form alism of Sec. II and III in Sec. IV to exam ine both longitudinal xx (H ;T ) and zz (H ;T ) as well as transverse xy (H ;T ) conductivities in the regim e of the freqency ! 0 and the tem perature T ! 0. F inally, in Sec. V we report on num erical calculations of the them altransport in the borocarbide LuN i2B2C and the A -15 superconductor V 3 Si and com pare our theoreticalplots with the available experim ental data.

### II. KUBO FORM ALISM IN THE LANDAU LEVEL PAIRING SCHEM E

Therm al conductivities can be calculated within the fram ew ork of the K ubo form alism as a linear response of a system to an external perturbation 11

$$\frac{\text{m}^{\circ}}{\text{m}} \text{ (\text{ }^{\circ}\text{T })} = \quad \frac{\text{m}}{\text{T}^{2}} \frac{\text{m}}{\text{m}} \frac{\text{rev}}{\text{s}} \text{ (\text{ }^{\circ}\text{I})} \tag{1}$$

where for ( ) = ij(i ) = d x1d x2 ij (1;2;i ); ij(1;2;i ) =

is the spatially averaged, nite tem perature them al current-current correlation finction tensor and 1=kB T . In order to derive the heat current operators j(1) and j(2) at the space time point 1 = (x1; ) and 2 = (x2;0) we follow the standard swave derivation in zero eld12 and generalize it to our case of a non-uniform

gap at high elds. A sim ilar approach was recently utilized in Ref. 9 for a d-w ave superconductor in zero eld. The heat current carried by the quasiparticles can be com puted within the standard variational procedure as

$$\mathbf{j} = \frac{\circledast \mathbf{r}\_{\mathbf{\tilde{a}}}}{\circledast \mathbf{r}\_{\mathbf{\tilde{a}}}} \mathbf{\tilde{a}} + \mathbf{r}\_{\mathbf{\tilde{a}}} \mathbf{\tilde{a}} \frac{\circledast \mathbf{r}\_{\mathbf{\tilde{a}}}}{\circledast \mathbf{r}\_{\mathbf{\tilde{a}}}} \mathbf{\tilde{a}} \tag{3}$$

from the Lagrangian density

$$\mathbf{L} = \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{L} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{m}m} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{r} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{r} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \end{array} + \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{r} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{r} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{r} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{r} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{r} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{r} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{r} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{r} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{r} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{r} \\ \mathbf{\tilde{e}} \\ \end{array} \end{array} \tag{4}$$

where all the energies are m easured with respect to the chem ical potential and - @ =@t. The N am bu's tw ocom ponent eld operators (r) are written in a com pact notation for the sake of brevity. In extreme type-II superconductors, as soon as the magnetic eld satis es H c1 (T ) the vector potential A A (r) can be safely assum ed to be entirely due to the external eld H = r diagram . We have used a simple BC S-m odel point interaction V (r1 22 ) = g (q (q expression (4). To lowest order in the concentration of im purities, the electron-im purity interaction can be om itted in com puting the heat current. The e ect of disorder will be included later in the G reen's functions for a superconductor. The variational procedure (3) yields

$$\mathbf{j\_{(f)}} = \begin{array}{ccccc} \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} & \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} & \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} & \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} \\ \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} & \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} & \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} & \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} \end{array} = \begin{array}{ccccc} \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} & \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} & \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} \\ \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} & \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} & \mathbf{j\_{(f)}} \end{array}$$

for the heat current operator. With this de nition it is straightforward to calculate the correlation tensor ij (1;2;i ) within the usual Hartree Fock approxim ation (i.e., bare bubble approxim ation) de ned by

where Gk1 is the N am bu's m atrix G reen's function. Inserting (5) into (2) and with the help of (6) the currentcurrent correlator becom es

$$\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\mathbf{1}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}}\mathbf{1}\mathbf{\hat{z}}\mathbf{\hat{z}}\mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} \\\\ \mathbf{\hat{z}}\mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} & \mathbf{\hat{z}} \\\\ \end{array}$$

It was show n in Ref. 1 that them ean- eld H am iltonian corresponding to the Lagrangian density (4) can be diagonalized in term s of the basis functions of the M agnetic

Sublattice Representation (M SR ), characterized by the quasim om entum q perpendicular to the direction of the m agnetic eld. The eigenfunctions of this representation in the Landau gauge A = H ( y;0;0;0) and belonging to the m th Landau level, are

Hm (x) is the Herm ite polynom ial of order m . Quasim om enta q are restricted to the rst M agnetic Brillouin Zone (M B Z ) spanned by vectors Q1 = Q;=1; b=12) and Q 2 = (0;2a=1).

N orm al and anom alous Green's finctions for a clean superconductor in this representation can be constructed as

$$\mathbf{G}\_{11} \text{ (L;2;1 \text{ }^\text{K}\text{)} = \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{X} \\ \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \\ \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \\ \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \end{array} \text{ ( $\mathbf{I}$  \text{ }^\text{K}\text{)} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{1cm}} \mathbf{\hspace{$$

where ! = (2m + 1) = are the electron M atsubara frequencies. Sim ilar expressions can be written for the rem aining two Nambu matrix elem ents. In writing (9) we have taken into account only diagonal (in Landau level index n) contributions to the Green's functions. This is a good approxim ation in high m agnetic elds where =h! c 1 and the num ber of occupied Landau levels no is not too large, which is the case for the extrem e type II system s under consideration. In this situation we are justi ed in using the diagonal approxim ation1-3, in which the BCS pairs are form ed by electrons belonging to mutually degenerate Landau levels located at the Ferm isurface while the contribution from Landau levels separated by h ! , or m ore is included in the renorm alization of the e ective coupling constant (g ! g (H ;T ) ) 13 . A s long as the m agnetic eld is larger than som e critical eld H (T ) the o -diagonal pairing does not change the qualitative behavior of the superconductor in a m agnetic eld. The critical eld H at T 0 can be estim ated

from the dH vA experim ents to be 0 :5H ~2 for A -15 and 0:2Hc2 for borocarbide superconductors4 .

where the + sign corresponds to xx (i ), the sign corresponds to i xy (i ) and ! = (2m + 1) = are electronic M atsubara frequencies. On the other hand the longitudinal (parallel to the external magnetic eld) currentcurrent correlation function 27 (i ) becom es

$$\mathbf{r}\_{zz} \text{ (i. ) = } \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{l}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{m}}^2 \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{X}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{X}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{X}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{x}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{x}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{x}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{x}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{x}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{x}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{x}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{x}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{x}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{x}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{x}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \right.$$

In order to perform the summ ation over the M atsubara frequencies ! , we introduce a spectral representation for the Nam bu m atrix Gn (kz;q; ! ) as

$$\mathbf{G}\_{\mathbf{n}} \otimes \mathbf{k}\_{\mathbf{z}}; \mathbf{q}; \mathbf{j} \text{ : } \mathbf{j} \text{ : } \mathbf{j} \text{ : } \frac{\mathbf{z}\_1}{\mathbf{z}\_1} \text{ : } \mathbf{q} \text{ : } \frac{\mathbf{z}\_1}{\mathbf{z}\_1} \text{ : } \mathbf{q} \text{ : } \mathbf{j} \text{ : } \mathbf{j} \text{ : } \mathbf{k}\_{\mathbf{z}}$$

where the spectral function m atrix An (Kz;q; ! ) is de ned as

$$\mathsf{R}\_{\mathsf{n}}\ \mathsf{q}\_{\mathsf{z}}\ \mathsf{q}\_{\mathsf{z}};\mathsf{q};\mathsf{:t}\ \mathsf{)=\qquad\mathsf{Ind}\ \mathsf{Tm}\ \mathsf{G}\_{\mathsf{n}}^{\mathsf{ret}}\ \mathsf{q}\_{\mathsf{z}};\mathsf{q};\mathsf{:t}\ \mathsf{):}\tag{1.3}$$

W hen the spectral representation of the G reen's functions (12) is used back in (10) and (11) respectively, we obtain

and

$$\mathbf{k}\_{xz} \text{ (i. ) = } \begin{array}{ccccc} \mathbf{l} & \mathbf{k} & \mathbf{k} & \mathbf{z} & \mathbf{d} & \mathbf{z} \\ \hline \mathbf{4m}^2 & & \mathbf{k}\_x^2 & \mathbf{d}! & \mathbf{l} & \mathbf{d}! & \mathbf{z} \\ \end{array}$$

$$\mathbf{S} = \frac{\mathbf{1}^{\mathbf{X}}}{\mathbf{1}}\_{\mathbf{1}} \mathbf{1}^{\mathbf{X}} \mathbf{1}\_{\{\mathbf{1} \neq \mathbf{1}\}} \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{1}\_{\{\mathbf{1} \neq \mathbf{1}\}} \mathbf{1}\_{\{\mathbf{1} \neq \mathbf{1}\}}} \frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{1}\_{\{\mathbf{1} \neq \mathbf{1}\}}} \mathbf{1} \mathbf{1}\_{\{\mathbf{1} \neq \mathbf{1}\}} \mathbf{1}\_{\{\mathbf{1} \neq \mathbf{1}\}} \mathbf{1}\_{\{\mathbf{1} \neq \mathbf{1}\}} \mathbf{1}\_{\{\mathbf{1} \neq \mathbf{1}\}} $$

T he sum can be evaluated in the standard way by picking up the contributions from each of the poles of the sum m and[11](#page-7-0).A ftertheanalyticcontinuation i ! + i we obtain the retarded function Sret

$$\mathbf{S}\_{\text{ret}} = \frac{\langle \mathfrak{Q} ! \mathbf{i}\_2 + \mathfrak{I} \rangle^2 \mathbf{n}\_\text{F} \ \langle \mathfrak{I} \mathbf{i}\_2 \rangle \qquad \langle \mathfrak{Q} ! \mathbf{i}\_1 \rangle \quad \langle \mathfrak{I} \mathbf{i}\_1 \rangle}{\mathbf{i}\_2 + \mathfrak{I}\_1 + \mathfrak{I}\_2 + \mathfrak{I}\_1} \quad \text{(17)}$$

In order to obtain the im aginary part of ij( ) we need to nd an im aginary part ofSret w hen calculating the longitudinal conductivity xx( ;T) and zz( ;T). O n the other hand,since Sret enters the expression for i xy( ) in [\(14\)](#page-2-0) we need to nd the realpart of Sret. U sing the identity

$$\frac{1}{\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{i}} = \mathbf{P} \frac{1}{\mathbf{x}} \qquad \mathbf{i} \qquad \text{(x)}\tag{18}$$

Sim ilarly, taking the realpart of (16) w ith the help of (18)yields for the o-diagonalconductivity:

Relations (28), (29) and (31) obtained when = 1 within the \linearized spectrum aproxim ation" tell us that there is still a considerable them al transport in the m ixed state of the superconductor. This is in stark contrast to the exponential suppresion of transport characteristic of an swave superconductor in zero eld. Furtherm ore, relations (28), (29) and (31) indicate that when passing from the norm al to the superconducting state, both longitudinal and transverse transport coe cients =T are reduced from their respective norm al state values by the factor ( = ) 2 (the term linear in (T= ) 2 is neqligible at low tem paratures even for very clean superconductors). The factor of the Ferm i surface G containing gapless quasiparticle excitations at T = 0. The size of G is determ ined by both the total num ber of nodes in the excitation spectrum (24) and the areas in di erent branches where the BCS gap is very small but not necessarily zero. This result, obtained here for the them al coe cients, is consistent with the behavior of som e other superconducting observables that m easure the presence of low -energy excitations at the Ferm i surface. One such experim entally con m ed behavior is the reduction of the de H aas-van A bhen (dH vA ) oscillation's am plitude in both A -15 and borocarbide superconductors when the sam ple becom es superconducting .

#### V . COM PARISON W ITH EXPERIM ENT

Recently, the longitudinal them al conductivity of the borocarbide superconductor LuNiB2C was measured down to T = 70 m K by Boaknin et al.10 in a magnetic eld from H = 0 to above H ~ = 7 Tesla. In the limit of T ! 0, a considerable them al transport is observed in them ixed state of the superconductor (H c1 < H = Hc2), indicating the presence of delocalized low energy excitations at the Ferm i surface. The authors argue that this observation is strong evidence for a highly anisotropic gap function in LuN 2B2C, possibly with nodes. On the other hand, no sizable them al conductivity was observed in zero eld, the result expected for a superconducting gap w ithout nodes.

The Boaknin et al. result is consistent with the observation of dH vA oscillations down to elds H H c2 =5 in YN 2B2C, a close cousin of LuN 2B2C as well as in V3Si where the oscillations persist down to elds Hc2=2.4 It was shown by us that the drop in н the dH vA am plitude observed in these experim ents can be atributed to the quantization of quasiparticle orbits within the superconducting state which results in the form ation of nodes in the gaps. This quantum regim e behavior in elds H < H < H < H < H < H < H < H < o -m ass m otion of the Cooper pairs, in contrast to the d-wave or anisotropic s-wave where nodes in the gap are due to the relative orbital motion. Therefore it makes sense to compare the theory developed in this paper with the experim ental data in Ref. 10. A quick check tells us that the expression (28), where (H )= (H )= (H ) < 1, does not hold through the entire range of elds used in the experim ent. Therefore, we num erically com pute the longitudinal them al conductivity directly from Eq. 19, without using any additional aproxim ations, for both the borocarbide superconductor LuN i2 B 2C as well as for the A -15 superconductor V 3Si.

In the lim it of ! 0 and T ! 0 the expression (19) yieks

$$\frac{1}{\text{T}} = \frac{\text{2}}{\text{12m}} \frac{\text{\AA}^{\text{e}}}{\text{h}!\text{\textdegree c}} \begin{array}{c} \text{\text{\textdegree X}} \\ \text{\text{\textdegree (n+1)}} \end{array} \frac{\text{X}}{\text{E}^{2}\_{\text{n};\text{\text{\textdegree p}}} \begin{array}{c} \text{\text{\textdegree X}} \\ \text{\text{\textdegree (k\_{x};\text{\textdegree q})}} \end{array} \frac{\text{1}}{\text{E}^{2}\_{\text{n+1};\text{\text{\textdegree q}}} \begin{array}{c} \text{\text{\textdegree C}} \\ \text{\text{\textdegree C}} \text{\text{\textdegree (k\_{x};\text{\textdegree q})}} \end{array} \tag{33}$$

where the number of Landau levels involved in superconducting pairing no = Er =h ! ~ varies as a function of magnetic eld. In the borocarbide superconductor LuN &B2C nc can be estim ated as no 33 at Hc2 and no 1147 at eld of H = 02 Tesla (these num bers were obtained using an e ective mass of 0:35m and Ferm i velocity VF = 2:76 - 10 cm /s as reported in Ref. 18). On the other hand, the num ber of occupied Landau levels in the A-15 superconductor V 3Si is m uch larger: ng 241 at H22 = 18:5 Tesla and ng 4470

at H = 1 Tesla (we used an e ective m ass of 1:7m e and Ferm i velocity vp = 2:8 = 10 cm /s from Ref. 19 in this estim ate). The scattering rate = (! = 0) in (33) is, in general, modi ed relative to the norm al state scattering rate o when the system becom es superconducting. Indexd, the sqif consistent calculation of

The dashed line in Fig. 1 show s the m agnetic eld dependence of the quasiparticle them al conductivity ==T for the borocarbide superconductor LuN i2B2C in the limit of T ! 0 obtained by the num erical evaluation of (33), where values for the BCS gap and norm al state inverse scattering rate o are taken from Ref. 10. The full circles in Fig. 1 are the experim ental data of Boaknin et al.10 for the sam e superconductor. The full line in Fig. 1 shows the theoretical plot obtained by num erical evaluation of (33) for the A-15 superconductor V3Siwhere values for and o o are taken from Ref. 19. There is a signi cant di erence in the behavior of =T in these two superconducting system s characterized by m uch sm aller them altransport in V 3 Siw hen com pared to the transport in LuN 22C in the sam e range ofm agnetic elds. This observation indicates that the num ber of gap less or near gapless excitations at the Ferm i surface in the V 3Si is very sm all at H H c2 . In order to understand this di erence, one has to notice that in m agnetic elds H < H = 0 ;5H c2 the num ber of occupied Landau levels in V 3 Si system is huge ( 4500) and that V3 Si is away from the regime of coherent gapless excitations of high elds. On the other hand, the num ber of occupied Landau levels in LuN 2B2C is much smaller ( 1000) and it seem s that there are stillm any gapless excitations left at low elds. It is suprising though that signi cant them al transport exists down to H 0:015H-2, a eld much smaller than the critical eld H = 0.2H cc for this system , where most of the quasiparticle spectrum should be gapped. Note, how ever, that a possible source for such a signi cant transport at low elds might be the highly anisotropic s-w ave gap finction in LuN i2B2C, as suggested in Ref. 10 . Ifthere is such an isotropy along one orm ore directions on the Ferm i surface, the range of validity of our theory m ay be extended to elds lower than the sim ple estim ate for H 20 In this regard, we alext the reader that at the lowest elds in Fig. 1 (H 0:04Hc2 ) our theory is stretched to its very limits and its quantitative accuracy dim inishes.

**Caption:** Figure 6 illustrates the magnetic field dependence of the quasiparticle longitudinal thermal conductivity (κ/T) for the superconductors LuNi2B2C and V3Si. The magnetic field (H) is measured in Tesla and is plotted on the x-axis, while κ/T is measured in milliwatts per Kelvin squared (mW/K²) on the y-axis. The dashed line represents theoretical predictions for LuNi2B2C, and the solid line represents predictions for V3Si, computed from Equation (33). Experimental data points from Boaknin et al. are plotted as filled circles for comparison. A vertical dotted line depicts the upper critical magnetic field transition (Hc2) at 7 Tesla for LuNi2B2C, whereas the Hc2 for V3Si at 18.5 Tesla is not shown on this axis. The significance of this figure lies in the comparison of thermal conductivity under magnetic fields between two distinct superconductors, highlighting that thermal transport is significantly higher in LuNi2B2C than in V3Si at equivalent magnetic fields. This observation suggests different distributions of gapless excitations at the Fermi surface between these two materials, impacting their superconducting properties and thermal transport behavior in magnetic fields.

The upper critical eld for V 3Si at H c2 = 18:5 Tesla is not shown. For LuN 2B2C we have used experim entally determ ined values for = 4:4 m eV and o = 0:5 from Ref. 10 as well as the e ective m ass m = 0:35m @ from Ref. 18. For V 3Si, = 2:6 m eV , n = 0:61 m eV and m = 1:7m 。 were taken from Ref. 19.

tion, them al currents perpendicular and parallel to the externalm agnetic eld. From there, current-current correlation functions are introduced within the M atsubara nite tem perature mechanism in order to derive closed expressions for them al conductivities ij ( ;T ).W e exam ine the transport coe cients i=T in the limit of 0 and T ! 0 and nd that there is considerable them altransport in them ixed state of a superconductor with an s-w ave symm etry due to the creation of gapless exitations in the magnetic eld. This is in contrast to the zero eld them al transport which is exponentially sm all for an sw ave superconductor with no nodes in the gap. Furtherm ore, when passing from the norm alto the superconducting state the them al coe cients = = = = = = = = com e reduced with respect to their nom al state values by a factor ( = ) 2 which measures the fraction of the Ferm i surface that contains coherent gapless or near gapless excitations in a magnetic eld. In this respect, them al conductivities behave sim ilarly to the dH vA oscillations in which the am plitude is also reduced at the superconducting transition . F inally, we num erically com pute the longitudinalthem al conductivity for two realistic superconducting system s, the borocarbide LuN 22C and the A-15 superconductor V3Si. The them altrans port in LuN &B2C is much larger in magnitude than the them al transport of V3Si at the same eld. This result indicates that the borocarbide LuN b22C m ight still be in the regim e of delocalized quasiparticle states even at elds much lower than the critical eld H 2 02Ho2
