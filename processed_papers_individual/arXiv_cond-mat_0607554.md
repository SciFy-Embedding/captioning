Inelastic light scattering is an intensively used toolin the study ofelectronic properties ofsolids. Triggered by the discovery ofhigh tem perature superconductivity in the cuprates and by new developm ents in instrum entation,light scattering both in the visible (R am an eect) and the X -ray part ofthe electrom agnetic spectrum has becom e a m ethod com plem entary to optical(infrared) spectroscopy w hile providing additional and relevant inform ation. T he m ain purpose of the review is to position R am an scattering w ith regard to single-particle m ethods like angle-resolved photoem ission spectroscopy (A R P E S), and other transport and therm odynam ic m easurem ents in correlated m aterials. Particular focus w illbe placed on photon polarizations and the role of sym m etry to elucidate the dynam ics of electrons in dierent regions of the B rillouin zone. T his advantage over conventional transport (usually m easuring averaged properties) indeed provides new insights into anisotropic and com plex m any-body behavior of electrons in various system s. W e review recent developm ents in the theory ofelectronic R am an scattering in correlated system s and experim ental results in paradigm atic m aterials such as the A 15 superconductors, m agnetic and param agnetic insulators, com pounds w ith com peting orders, as w ell as the cuprates w ith high superconducting transition tem peratures. W e present an overview of the m anifestations of com plexity in the R am an response due to the im pact of correlations and developing com peting orders. In a variety ofm aterials w e discuss w hich observations m ay be understood and sum m arize im portant open questions that pave the w ay to a detailed understanding of correlated electron system s.

R am an scattering is a photon-in photon-out process w ith energy transfered to a targetm aterial. M ostofthe light is elastically scattered from the sam ple,a fraction is color-shifted and collected atthe detector.

Light couples to electronic charge in solids and can scatter inelastically from m any types of excitations in a sam ple, as show n schem atically for Y Ba2C u3O <sup>6</sup>:<sup>5</sup> in Figure 1. O pticalphonons produce sharp peaks at well know n positions and orientations of the incom ing and outgoing photon polarizations,w hile a large broad featurecentered atm uch higherenergiesdueto two-m agnon scattering occurs in com pounds w ith antiferrom agnetic correlations. T his review article largely places em phasis on the electronic R am an scattering continuum upon w hich the phononsand m agnonsare superim posed.

Light scatters o of electrons by creating variations ofelectronic charge density in the illum inated region of a sam ple. By observing the frequency shift and polarization change ofthe outgoing photon com pared to the incom ing photon,the properties ofcharge density relaxation ism easured.H owever,m easuring the R am an eect ofphotonsscattering from electronsisa dicultproposal to carry forward.Itism ade dicultprecisely because of the coupling ofthe realphoton vector potentialand the exchange ofvirtualphotonsw hich m ediate the C oulom b forces between electrons. In sim ple m etals,variations of the charge density w ill be largely screened by the m obile electrons,and the system ofelectrons responds collectively at a characteristic plasm a frequency ofseveral electron volts.In sem iconductorsorwell-developed band insulators,the creation ofchargedensity 
uctuationsoccurs only via the population of excited states across a band gap - again on the scale of severalelectron volts. T hereforeitisdicultto investigatethebehaviorofelectrons at low energies. In fact,hardly any m easurem ents ofelectronicR am an scattering in sim plem etalsexistprecisely forthisreason,and focuson sem iconductorsisusually placed on plasm a excitations. Since the dynam ics ofelectrons lying near the Ferm isurface govern the behavioroftransportin m ost system s,this would give the im pression that R am an would have but little to oer in sim ple m etals and insulators.

Yetthe R am an eectisextrem ely wellsuited to study electrons in system s w ith non-trivialelectron dynam ics. Firstwell-studied in thecontextofbreaking C ooperpairs in superconductorsin the period from 1980 to 1990,the eld ofR am an scattering from electronic excitationshas grow n trem endously over the past few decades to study the evolution ofelectron correlationsin a variety ofsystem s in w hich m any-body interactions are essential to the physics ofnew m aterials and their potentialdevice applications.

R am an spectroscopy hasbecom e an indispensable tool in thearsenalforunderstanding m any-body physics.O ne

ofthe m ostcelebrated achievem entsofelectronic R am an scattering has been the ability to focus on the nature ofelectron dynam ics in dierent regions ofthe Brillouin zone. T his distinguishes R am an scattering from m ost other transport and therm odynam ic m easurem ents, allow ing the study of the developm ent of correlations in projected regionsofthe Brillouin zone.By sim ply aligning the polarization orientations of the incom ing and outgoing photons, charge excitations can be selectively m apped and analyzed using group-theoreticalsym m etry argum ents. T he search for conventionalas well as exotic excitations in strongly correlated m atter has been greatly enhanced.R am an spectroscopy hasprovided new and valuable insights into unconventionalsuperconductivity and collective m odes, excitations in charge, spin and/or orbitally ordered system s as wellas the com petition between the various ordered phases. In addition, new insights into electron dynam ics of m etal-insulator transitions,quantum phasetransitions,and theconcom itant quantum criticalbehavior could be obtained. T he purpose ofthis article is to review the essence ofthese new developm entsin a \snapshot" ofthe currentstate of investigation.

T he overallagenda ofthe paperisto provide a vehicle to sort through the extensive literature,learn about the outstanding problem s,and becom e aware ofthe levelof consensus. In order to present a detailed picture ofthe currentstatusofelectroniclightscattering,othertypesof excitations,such asphononsand m agnons,arem ainly ignored. T here have been m any review s on inelastic light scattering from phonons and m agnons. T he reader is referred to earlier review s by K lein (1982b) for a fundam ental treatm ent of scattering from phonons, w hile studies of phonons in high tem perature superconductors are sum m arized by T hom sen (1989) and Sherm an etal.(2003).R ecently Lem m ensetal.(2003)and G ozar etal.(2005b)reviewed m agnetic light scattering in low dim ensionalquantum spin system sand cuprates.D ue to space lim itations we cannot give adequate com m entary on these exciting and developing elds.

### B . H istoricalReview

Inelastic scattering of light was discovered independently in organicliquidsby R am an and K rishnan (1928) and in quartzby Landsberg and M andelstam (1928)w ho properly explained the observed eect: T he energy of the incom ing photon is split between the scattered one and an elem entary excitation in the solid.Shortly thereafterin 1930 C .V .R am an wasawarded the N obelprize, and hisnam e wasassociated w ith the eect(Fabelinski, 1998;G inzburg,1998;Pleijel,1930). A lthough the phenom enologicaldescription by Sm ekal(1923) in term s of a periodically m odulated polarizability qualitatively captures the relevant physics including the selection rules, the eect is genuinely quantum m echanicalas described rstand ahead oftheexperim entaldiscovery by K ram ers and H eisenberg (1925)in contextofthe dispersion in dielectrics.

Soon after the observation oflight scattering from vibrational excitations, Verkin and Lazarev (1948) and K hakin and Bykov (1956) attem pted to use the new technique for studying electronic excitations. T hey picked one of the m ost am bitious subjects, i.e., light scattering from superconducting gap excitations in conventional m etals. It is not at all surprising that they

could not succeed. In a sem inal paper A brikosov and Fal'kovski (1961) not only calculated the R am an response of a typical elem ental superconductor but also dem onstrated that the sensitivity in the early experim ents was by approxim ately 5 or 6 orders of m agnitude too low . In 1980 light was nally scattered successfully from superconducting electrons in 2H N bSe<sup>2</sup> (Sooryakum ar and K lein, 1980). Balseiro and Falicov (1980) and Littlewood and Varm a (1981,1982) argued that the superconducting excitations in this system becom eR am an activem ainly via theircoupling to a chargedensity wave m ode (C D W ). A fter the observation of gap excitations in the A 15 com pounds N b3Sn and V3Si (D ierker et al., 1983; H ackl et al., 1982, 1983; K lein, 1982a) it was clear that light can be scattered directly by C ooperpairs(D ierkeretal.,1983;K lein and D ierker, 1984).T utt}o and Zawadow ski(1992)dem onstrated that both types ofcoupling contribute.

C ollectiveexcitationsofnorm alelectronswererstobserved in sem iconductors(M ooradian and W right,1966) follow ing theoreticalstudies by Pines (1963),Platzm an and T zoar (1964). A s a function ofdoping the plasm on peak m ovesacrossthe phonon energiesleading to strong electron-lattice interactions. In heavily doped silicon, w ith the plasm a energy wellbeyond the vibration spectrum ,the evolution ofthe phonon line shape (C erdeira et al.,1973;Fano,1961) clearly dem onstrated the existence of an electron continuum . In 1977, 
uctuations ofelectrons between pockets ofthe Ferm isurface ofsilicon were observed by C handrasekhar et al.(1977) and explained subsequently by Ipatova etal.(1981).In m agneticelds,transitionsbetween Landau levelswerefound (W orlock et al.,1981)<sup>1</sup>. Strong phonon renorm alization

<sup>1</sup> T he subject has been review ed in detail by A bstreiter et al.

eects also occur in m etallic alloys w ith A 15 structure (Schicktanz et al.,1980;W ipfet al.,1978). T he origin of the broad continuum , w hich interacts w ith phonons and is redistributed below the superconducting transition (K lein and D ierker,1984),iscertainly electronicbut as oftoday is stillnotfully understood.

T he fullpower ofthe m ethod becam e apparent after thediscovery ofcopper-oxygen com pounds(Bednorzand M uller,1986) w ith superconducting transition tem peratures above 100 K . It turned out that, in contrast to infrared spectroscopy, m om entum dependent transport properties can be m easured w ith R am an spectroscopy, since dierent regions ofthe Brillouin zone can be projected out independently by appropriately selecting the polarizations ofthe incident and scattered photons (D evereaux et al., 1994a). N ew theoreticalideas were not only applied to the superconducting but also to the norm alstate.T hespectra extend overenergy rangesaslarge aselectron Volts(eV )(Bozovicetal.,1987;C ooperetal., 1988a,b;K irillov etal.,1988)and are sim ilarto those in the A 15s or in rare earth elem ents (K lein et al.,1991). Both elastic (Zawadow ski and C ardona, 1990) and inelastic (Itai,1992;K ostur,1991;V irosztek and R uvalds, 1992) relaxation ofelectrons indeed produces light scattering over such a broad range ofenergies. It soon becam eclearthata continuum extending overan eV cannot originate from elastic scattering,but only from inelastic processes or interband transitions. H owever,it has not been straightforward to pin dow n the types of interactions.

A t very low energies, spin- (Yoon et al., 2000) and charge-ordering
uctuationswerereported in m anganites and,respectively,in laddercom pounds(Blum berg etal., 2002)and in the cuprates (Venturinietal.,2002b).T he response should notbe confused w ith thatofan ordered spin/charge-density-wave (SD W /C D W ) state (Benfatto etal.,2000;K lein,1982c;Zeyherand G reco,2002).Since a characteristic energy decreases rather than increases upon cooling (Blum bergetal.,2002;C apraraetal.,2002, 2005;Venturinietal.,2002b;Yoon etal.,2000),w hich is in clearcontrastto typicalorder param eterbehavior.

A long w ith the early studies of charge excitations, Fleury and coworkers observed R am an scattering from spin wavesin antiferrom agnetically ordered FeF2,M nF2, and K <sup>2</sup>N iF<sup>4</sup> (Fleury etal.,1966,1967,1970).Elliotand Loudon (1963)and Fleury and Loudon (1968)presented a detailed theoreticaldescription w hich allowed them to sem i-quantitatively understand the spectral shape and the cross section. W ith the discovery ofthe cuprates by Bednorz and M uller (1986) also this eld experienced a renaissancein particularforthestudy atlow doping close to the antiferrom agnetic N eelstate (G ozar et al.,2004, 2005b; Lyons et al., 1988; Sugaiet al., 1988; Sulew ski et al., 1991). R am an scattering is probably the m ost

precise m ethod fordeterm ining the exchange coupling J though the theoreticalunderstanding is stillincom plete. In this context,spin-Peierls system s (Loosdrecht et al., 1996) and ladder com pounds (A brashev et al., 1997) shifted very m uch into the focus of interest (D agotto, 1999).

Very recently, light scattering from \orbitons", i.e. from a propagating reorientation of orbitals, has been proposed to explain new m odes in the the R am an spectra (Saitoh etal.,2001).H owever,there isno agreem ent yeton w hetherornotorbitonscan be observed independent ofphonons or other excitations (C hoiet al.,2005; G runingeretal.,2002;K rugeretal.,2004).

### C. W hat Can O ne Learn from Electronic Ram an Scattering?

W e give now a qualitative introduction into the relationship between R am an spectroscopy and other experim entaltechniques. W e begin by draw ing the distinction between one-particle and m any-particle properties.

Typically,electronic states in solids are characterized by their energy dispersions as wellas the characteristic lifetim e of an electron placed into such a state. T his state is characterized by the single particle propagator orG reen's function for the electron,

$$\mathcal{G}\_{\mathbb{Q}}(\mathbb{k};\mathbb{t},\mathbb{t}) = \frac{1}{\underbrace{!}\_{k} \qquad \mathbb{k} : \mathbb{t} : \mathbb{t}} : \tag{1}$$

H ere <sup>k</sup> denotes the bare energy band dispersion calculated from a solvable m odel. represents the electron self-energy w hich encom passes allthe inform ation pertaining to interactions ofthe single electron in state k to all other excitations of the system . U sually the selfenergy can only be obtained via approxim ate m ethods. Som e of these approxim ations are quite good such as electron-phonon interactions in m etals (know n asM igdal'sapproach (M igdal,1958))forexam ple,w hile others are m ore dicult -such as the C oulom b interaction between other electrons. T he selfenergy is a com plex function, = <sup>0</sup>+ i <sup>00</sup>,w hich,in general,depends on tem perature,m om entum and energy.T he realpartof the selfenergy determ ines how the energy dispersion <sup>k</sup> is renorm alized by the interactions w hile the im aginary part determ ines the lifetim e ofthe quasiparticle placed into the state k.

T he spectralfunction isdirectly related to the analytically continued electron'sG reen'sfunction forfrequencies on the realaxis via the replacem enti! ! ! + i

$$\mathbf{A} \ll \mathbf{\hat{z}} \mathbf{:} \mathbf{:} \mathbf{1} \mathbf{) = \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{\hat{z}} \\ \mathbf{\hat{z}} \end{array} \tag{2}$$

w hich is m easurable via m odern angle-resolved photoem ission (A R PES) techniques and has provided an im m ense am ountofinform ation in strongly correlated system s (C am puzano et al.,2002;D am ascelliet al.,2003). For non-interacting electrons, A(k;!) is a -function

<sup>4</sup>

peaked at the pole of the propagator w hen the frequency ! equals the bare band energy <sup>k</sup> . Interactionsbroaden thespectralfunction and giveitnon-trivial tem perature and frequency dependences as wellas nontrivial anisotropies in m om entum -space if the interactionsam ong electronsareanisotropic.T hespectralfunction describes realelectrons,hence integrals over allenergies m ust obey sum rules,such as (i) R d!A(k;!)= 1 and (ii) R d!f(!)A(k;!) = n(k) w ith the Ferm iD irac distribution f(!) and the m om entum distribution function n(k).

Iftheelectronicinteractionsareweak,oneusually uses the nom enclature ofLandau and refersto dressed quasiparticles replacing the electron as the fundam entalexcitation in the solid.T hese interactionsm ay be characterized by the residue ofthe pole (usually denoted by Zk) and the quasiparticle eective m ass m =m <sup>b</sup> = (Z<sup>k</sup> ) 1 w ith m <sup>b</sup> the bare band m assforquasiparticleslying near the Ferm isurface. Z<sup>k</sup> is related to the realpart ofthe selfenergy <sup>0</sup> w hich can be expanded for electrons near the Ferm i surface as <sup>0</sup>(k;!) ' 0 <sup>0</sup>(k)+ !@ <sup>0</sup>(k;! = 0)=@!. A ccording to Luttinger's theorem , the Ferm i surface average of <sup>0</sup> <sup>0</sup>(k) vanishes. T he enhancem ent of the quasiparticle m ass over the band m ass can be w ritten as m =m <sup>b</sup> = (1 @ <sup>0</sup>=@!). O ne often denes m =m <sup>b</sup> = 1 + w ith the dim ensionless coupling constant 0 (see, e.g., (A shcroft and M erm in, 1976)). Z<sup>k</sup> = (1 @ <sup>0</sup>=@!) <sup>1</sup> isalwayssm allerthan 1,re
ecting the fact that even for ! = 0 and T = 0 only a fraction Z<sup>k</sup> ofthe spectralweight(coherentpart)isin the pole of A(k;!)w hile 1 Z<sup>k</sup> (incoherentpart)isdistributed over largerenergy scales.Equivalently,Z<sup>k</sup> 1 isthediscontinuity atk<sup>F</sup> ofthezero-tem peraturem om entum distribution function n(k). IfZ<sup>k</sup> approacheszero (/ 1=ln!)the system is referred to as a m arginalFerm iliquid (Varm a et al.,1989a),and sum rule (i) is exhausted only at energies m uch larger than <sup>k</sup> . T hus,know ledge ofthe self energy isan im portantrequisite to understanding m anybody interactions.

For this reason, single particle m ethods such as A R PES, electron tunneling and specic heat m easurem ents have been applied extensively to study correlated electron system s. Very m uch stim ulated by the discovery of superconductivity in the cuprates (Bednorz and M uller,1986) A R PES and tunneling spectroscopy have developed m ore rapidly than any other m ethod in the last decade. A R PES data has given unprecedented insight into m om entum -resolved single electron properties and their m any body eects (C am puzano et al., 2002; D am ascelliet al.,2003),w hile tunneling m easurem ents have provided inform ation on pairing (M andrus, 1991; R enner,1995;Zasadzinskietal.,2002)and haverecently elucidated m any issues of nanoscale inhom ogeneities in the cuprates and their connection to superconductivity (Fang etal.,2006;H anagurietal.,2004;H om an etal., 2002;H owald et al.,2003;K ivelson et al., 2003;M cElroy et al.,2003,2005;Vershinin et al.,2004). D etailed know ledge ofphase transitions in the cuprates has been

obtained from specic heat studies (Loram and Tallon, 2001;M oler et al., 1994; R oulin et al., 1998). D ue to spacelim itationsweonly havelisted som eofthelaterreferencesofim portantexperim entalpapersw hich we hope serveasan entry pointforthereaderto search backwards in tim e to follow the developm ents.

Yet know ledge of the spectral function and singleparticleexcitation spectra do notyield inform ation about how the electrons m ay transport heat,current,entropy, or energy. For this one needs two-particle correlation functions for charge or spin w hich can be m easured by, e.g.,ordinary and heat transport,opticalspectroscopy, neutron and light scattering. A s an exam ple for such a correlation function we consider a standard expression forthe generalized K ubo susceptibility <sup>00</sup> a;b( )ofweakly interacting,isotropic norm alelectrons (see,e.g.,M ahan (2000)),

$$\mathbf{f}\_{\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}}^{\text{(0)}}\left(\mathbf{f}\right) = \underbrace{\mathbf{Z}}\_{\mathbf{V}} \underbrace{\mathbf{X}}\_{\mathbf{k}} \mathbf{b}\_{\mathbf{k}} \mathbf{b}\_{\mathbf{k}} \overset{\mathbf{Z}\_{\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}}}{\mathbf{z}}\_{\mathbf{1}} \mathbf{f} \overset{\mathbf{G}}{\mathbf{z}}\_{\mathbf{1}} \mathbf{G}^{\text{(0)}} \{\mathbf{k};\mathbf{i}\} \mathbf{G}^{\text{(0)}} \{\mathbf{k};\mathbf{j}\} + \mathbf{J} \tag{3}$$
 
$$\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{f} \ \mathbf{f} \ \mathbf{i} \end{bmatrix} \qquad \mathbf{f} \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{i} \ \mathbf{i} + \ \mathbf{j} \end{bmatrix} \mathbf{j} : \tag{4}$$

H ere V is the volum e,a<sup>k</sup> ;b<sup>k</sup> are the bare vertices representing quasiparticle charge (a<sup>k</sup> = 1) or current (a<sup>k</sup> = j<sup>k</sup> = ek)correlation functions,and the factor2 accounts for spin degeneracy. T he absorptive part ofthe conductivity <sup>0</sup> = 00 j;j( )= m easures essentially a convolution ofoccupied and unoccupied states.Forelectronsweakly interacting w ith im purities the conductivity can readily be calculated to exhibit a Lorentzian dependence on represented by

$$\mathbf{r}\_{\odot}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{\mathbf{r}\_{\odot}(\mathbf{r}) + \mathbf{r}\_{\odot}(\mathbf{r})^2} \tag{4}$$

w here <sup>0</sup> is the dc ( = 0) conductivity,and the relaxation tim e = ~(2<sup>00</sup>) <sup>1</sup> controls both the w idth of the spectralfunction and the conductivity as a function offrequency.<sup>2</sup> A very sim ilarexpression isfound forlight scattering<sup>3</sup>. T hus in the case non-interacting electrons, single and two-particle correlation functions give sim ilar results.

T his is also true by and large if weak but essentially isotropic interactions lead to an energy dependent <sup>00</sup>(!) and, for causality, to a nite <sup>0</sup>(!). G otze and W ol

referred to as the extended D rude m odel. H owever,interacting system s require som e care. For exam ple, in superconductors, both the single and the two-particle responses yield the energy gap. Yet two-particle correlation functions also have coherence factors w hich can be crucially im portant to determ ine the gap sym m etry in unconventionalsystem s. G enerally,collective m odes (such asthe plasm on orexcitons)appeardirectly in twoparticle correlation functions but only indirectly in the spectralfunction.

Som etim es the results from single- and two-particle m easurem ents can be qualitatively dierent, even for non-interacting electrons.A san illustration,we consider

rstthe m etal-insulatortransition occurring in a system ofotherw ise non-interacting electronsin a disordered environm ent (A nderson transition). H ere, backscattering of electrons from im purities leads to destructive phase interference,and the electrons becom e localized once a critical concentration of im purities is in place in three dim ensions. T hus w hile the conductivity is criticaland vanishes at the m etal-insulator transition, the spectral function,or equivalently the density ofstates,is uncritical. T his distinction becom es even m ore pronounced if the electron interactionsare strong and anisotropic,and the bare vertices along w ith the G reen's functions entering into Eq.(3) m ust be renorm alized by the strong interactions.

A s a second exam ple,in the spinless Falicov-K im ball m odellight d electrons strongly interact w ith localized f electrons and are characterized by the H am iltonian (Falikov and K im ball,1969)

$$\begin{array}{ccccc} \mathbf{H} &=& \underbrace{\mathbf{\dot{t}}}\_{\mathbf{\dot{D}}} \underbrace{\mathbf{X}}\_{\mathbf{D}} \\ & \mathbf{X} & \mathbf{\dot{U}}\_{\mathbf{\dot{i}}} \mathbf{\dot{U}}\_{\mathbf{\dot{i}}} + \mathbf{c}\_{\mathbf{\dot{j}}}^{\mathbf{V}} \mathbf{c}\_{\mathbf{\dot{i}}} \mathbf{\dot{I}} + \mathbf{E}\_{\mathbf{\dot{f}}} & \mathbf{w}\_{\mathbf{\dot{i}}} \\ \mathbf{X} & & \mathbf{X} & \mathbf{\dot{t}} \\ & \mathbf{c}\_{\mathbf{\dot{i}}}^{\mathbf{V}} \mathbf{c}\_{\mathbf{\dot{i}}} + \mathbf{w}\_{\mathbf{\dot{i}}} \mathbf{\dot{t}} & \mathbf{U} & \mathbf{c}\_{\mathbf{\dot{i}}}^{\mathbf{V}} \mathbf{c}\_{\mathbf{\dot{i}}} \mathbf{w}\_{\mathbf{\dot{i}}} \\ & \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} \end{array} \end{array} \tag{5}$$

In system s w ith strong and anisotropic interactions, thedierencesbetween singleand two-particleproperties

are inescapable. T his is been borne out in the cuprates by the large am ount of work using optical (H om es et al.,2004) and therm alconductivities (Sutherland etal., 2005),resistivities (A ndo etal.,2004),nuclear m agnetic resonance (N M R ) (A llouletal.,1989)and electron spin resonance (ESR ) (Janossy et al., 2003). T hese experim ents have revealed basic properties of strongly correlated system sand have em erged askey elem entsto characterize the com plex behaviorofthe high-T<sup>c</sup> cuprates.

A s far as carriers are concerned, the m om entum dependence ofneutron scattering serves m ainly to m easure spin dynam ics in dierent regions of the Brillouin zone.

### D . State ofthe A rt Experim entalTechnique

O ver decades R am an scattering was predom inantly used for the study of m olecular and lattice vibrations w hich produce isolated and typically narrow lines in the

spectra (see Fig.1). T he lines are used as probes w hich sensitively reactto changesin the environm entofthe vibrating atom s.Sim ilarconsiderationsare atthe heartof m agnetic resonance techniques such as N M R and ESR .

Iflightisscattered from electronsin solids,thespectra are usually continuous(Fig.1).To study theirevolution as a function of a control param eter, such as tem perature, doping, m agnetic eld or pressure, is rather involved since the overall shape and not the position of well-dened lines m atters.In addition,typicalcrosssectionsperunitsolid angle and energy intervalare sm aller by severalorders ofm agnitude than those ofvibrations. Electronic R am an scattering in a m etal typically producesone energy-shifted photon pers,m eV ,and sr(unit solid angle steradian) out of 10<sup>13</sup> incom ing ones. T he low eciency isparticularly dem anding in studiesathigh pressuresinceadditionallossesand com plicationssuch as uorescence and birefringence arise from the w indow s, w hich aretypically diam ond anvils.A lthough there were successfulearly experim ents(Zhou etal.,1996)theavailability of synthetic diam onds brought substantial advances (G oncharov and Struzhkin,2003).

T here are three inventions w hich nally produced the required sensitivity: (i) the laser as an intense light sourceproviding linesofhigh spectralpurity in a w ideenergy range,(ii)asan early application ofthe laser,holographically fabricated gratingsw ithoutsecondary im ages (ghosts)and an extrem ely low levelofdiusely scattered light and, nally, (iii) the invention of charge-coupled devices (C C D ) as a location-sensitive detector w ith an eciency atthe quantum lim itand negligible dark count rate.

G ratings have an extrem ely well dened num ber of lines per unit length (cm in the cgs system ). T his is the origin ofthe energy unit cm <sup>1</sup> . T he follow ing conversionsare frequently used:

$$\begin{array}{rcl} \text{1 m } \euro \text{V } &=& \text{11 } \pounds 04 \text{ K} \\ \text{1 m } \euro \text{V } &=& \pounds \pounds \pounds 55 \text{ cm}^{-1} \\ &=& \pounds \pounds 9504 \pounds \pounds \pounds \end{array}$$

Since the C C D hasa high spatialresolution dow n to a few m it is a superior replacem ent ofthe photographic plate.Itfacilitatesrecording com pletespectra in a single exposure w ith energy ranges from m eV up to approxim ately 1 eV ,depending on the desired resolution.

T he essentials ofa setup for inelastic light scattering w ith polarized photonsareshow n schem atically in Fig.2. T he coherentlightatenergy ~!<sup>i</sup> from the laser(A r<sup>+</sup> and K r<sup>+</sup> gaslasersare stillvery popular)isspatially ltered. A prism m onochrom ator (PM C ) selects the desired frequency and suppressesincoherentphotonsfrom the laser m edium . A com bination ofa =2 retarder and a polarizer (P1) facilitates the preparation ofa photon 
ux of a well-dened polarization state and intensity. For excitation,the polarization inside the sam ple counts. T he sam e holds for the selection of the proper polarization for the scattered photons at ~!s. T he best results are

H igh speed optics collects the scattered light. T he polarization state isselected by a =4 retarderand polarizer P2. T he =2 retarder in front of the entrance slit rotates the light polarization for m axim altransm ission ofthe spectrom eter(here single stage). Exceptfor the com pensator m ost retarders and polarizers work also for light propagating atsm allangles(up to approxim ately 5 )w ith respectto the opticalaxis. T he conguration show n here is usually referred to as back-scattering geom etry since incom ing and outgoing photons have essentially opposite m om enta in the sam ple.

obtained by using a crystalpolarizer (P1,e.g. ofG lan-T hom pson type) and a Soleil-Babinet com pensator for the incom ing light and an achrom atic =4 retarder and another crystalpolarizer (P2) for the scattered light. In this way all states, including circularly polarized ones, can be prepared. T he =2 retarder in front of the entrance slit of the spectrom eter rotates the polarization into the direction ofhighestsensitivity.

T he rst two are usually subtractively coupled and select a band from the spectrum of inelastically scattered photons.T hethird stagedisperses the band transm itted through the two stages ofthe prem onochrom atorinto a spectrum w hich isrecorded by the C C D .In this conguration,the dispersion is given only by the third stage w hile the rst two discrim inate the elastically scattered laser light. Ifallstages are coupled additively, the resolution is im proved by a factor of 3. Because oflossesat the m irrorsand gratings,only 15 to 20 % ofthe photons entering the spectrom eter arrive at the detector.

Since very interesting physics is going on at energies even below 1 m eV (see,e.g.,section IV .D .3)the discrim ination is a cardinalpoint. O ut ofthe two options only the prem onochrom ator gives satisfactory results below 10 m eV .T he price one has to pay is a loss ofintensity ofapproxim ately 60 % . A lternatively,for energy shifts above10 m eV an interferom etricnotch ltercan beused. T he latter device is w idely used for com m ercialapplicationsw hich develop rapidly since the introduction ofthe C C D .T he m ain elds are quality controland analytics.

A t nite tem peratures,T > 0,inelastically scattered light is found on either side of~!i. A s a consequence of tim e-reversalsym m etry and for phase space argum ents the energy gain (A nti-Stokes) and loss (Stokes) spectra are related by the principle ofdetailed balance (equivalentto the 
uctuation-dissipation theorem )(Landau and Lifshitz,1960;Placzek,1934)

$$\frac{\mathbf{N}\_{\mathsf{N}\_{\mathsf{ST}}}}{\mathbf{N}\_{\mathsf{ST}}} = \underbrace{\mathbf{!}\_{\mathsf{i}} + \mathbf{}\_{\mathsf{i}}}\_{\mathbf{i}} \quad \overset{\mathsf{2}}{\mathsf{exp}} \qquad \frac{\mathbf{\tilde{\mathbf{\cdot}}}}{\mathbf{k}\_{\mathsf{B}} \ \mathbf{T}} \tag{7}$$

Ifspectra arem easured in largeenergy ranges,thesensitivity ofthe instrum ent has to be taken into account. To this end,the spectralresponse ofthe w hole system , including allopticalelem entsbetween thesam pleand the entrance slitofthe spectrom eter,the spectrom eteritself, and the detector,m ust be calibrated. T his is best done by replacing the sam ple w ith a continuous light source ofthe sam e size as the laser spot w ith a know n spectral em issivity. A continuous source is ofcrucialim portance for including the energy dependence ofthe dispersion in addition to the bare transm ission. In addition,the frequency dependence of the sam ple's index of refraction, <sup>p</sup> "= n + ik,requiresattention in orderto getthe internalcrosssection.

T he m ain lim itations of present com m ercial system s com e from geom etricalaberrations of the spectrom eter optics and from the relatively low total re
ectivity of the large num ber ofm irrors. It is a m atter ofresources to im prove these caveats. R ecently, an im proved type of triple spectrom eter w ith aspherical optics has been described by Schulzetal.(2005).C C D sand gratingsare close to the theoreticallim its.

For m any studies,light sources w ith continuously adjustable lines in an extended energy range would be desirable. T his holds particularly true for organic m aterials (e.g. carbon nanotubes or proteins) w hich have relatively sharp resonances in the visible and the ultraviolet. T he synchrotron,free electron \lasers",as wellas dye and solid-state lasersare developing rapidly and w ill gain in

T he aim ofthis section is to form ulate the theoretical treatm entsforinelastic lightscattering in general.M uch hasbeen done in the developm entoftheoriesforR am an scattering,particularly in sem iconductorsand superconductors.Excellentand early review sofelectronicR am an scattering havebeen given by K lein (1983)and A bstreiter et al. (1984) focusing on sem iconductors. M ore recent review s by D evereaux and K am pf (1997) and Sherm an et al.(2003) have focused on theory in superconductors w ith applications towards the cuprates. W e outline the general form alism for treating system s w ith weak and strong correlations and return to a discussion ofvarious theoretical m odels in connection w ith m aterials in the follow ing section.

#### 1. GeneralApproach

W e rst consider a H am iltonian for N electrons coupled to the electrom agneticelds(Blum ,1970;Pinesand N ozieres,1966):

$$\mathbf{H}^{\mathsf{H}} = \sum\_{\begin{subarray}{c} \mathsf{i} \\ \mathsf{i} \end{subarray}}^{\mathsf{H}^{\mathsf{h}}} \frac{\mathsf{Q}^{\mathsf{i}} + \mathsf{i} \mathsf{j} \mathsf{e} \mathsf{c} \mathsf{c} \mathsf{j} \mathsf{A}^{\mathsf{h}} \mathsf{ (}\mathsf{x}\_{\mathsf{i}}\mathsf{i}\}^{\mathsf{i}}}{\mathsf{2m}} + \mathsf{H}^{\mathsf{C}\ \mathsf{c} \mathsf{u} \mathsf{l} \mathsf{k} \mathsf{m} \mathsf{b}} + \mathsf{H}^{\mathsf{C}\ \mathsf{c} \mathsf{k} \mathsf{k} \mathsf{m} \mathsf{b}} \quad \text{(\&)}$$

w here ^p = i~r is the m om entum operator, e is the m agnitude ofthe elem entary charge (the electronic charge isq<sup>e</sup> = e) and c the speed oflight.A^(ri) is the vector potentialof the eld at space-tim e point r<sup>i</sup> and m the electron m ass. H C oulom b represents the C oulom b interaction and H elds the free electrom agnetic part.W e use the sym bolA^ to denote operators. W e expand the kinetic energy to obtain

$$\mathbf{H} = \mathbf{H} \mathbf{0}^{0} + \underbrace{\mathbf{e}\mathbf{e}}\_{\mathbf{2m}\mathbf{C}} \mathbf{X} \mathbf{H} \mathbf{e}\_{\mathbf{i}} \quad \mathbf{\hat{A}} \ \left(\mathbf{r}\_{\mathbf{i}}\right) + \mathbf{\hat{A}} \left(\mathbf{r}\_{\mathbf{i}}\right) \quad \mathbf{\hat{P}} $$

$$+ \underbrace{\mathbf{e}^{2}}\_{\mathbf{2m}\mathbf{C}^{2}} \int\_{\mathbf{i}}^{\mathbf{i}} \mathbf{\hat{A}} \left(\mathbf{r}\_{\mathbf{i}}\right) \cdot \mathbf{\hat{A}} \left(\mathbf{r}\_{\mathbf{i}}\right) \mathbf{\hat{r}} \tag{9}$$

w ith H <sup>0</sup> = H <sup>0</sup> + H elds and H <sup>0</sup> = (1=2m ) P i ^p 2 <sup>i</sup> + H C oulom b. G enerally we choosej ito denote eigenstates ofH <sup>0</sup> w ith eigenvaluesE : H <sup>0</sup>j i= E j i. T he eigenstate is labeled by allthe relevantquantum num bers for the state,such as com binations ofband index,wavevector,orbitaland/or spin quantum num bers,for exam ple. T he eigenstatesm ay be considered to be Bloch electrons w hen the electron-ion interaction is included in H <sup>0</sup>, as

plane-wavestatesifitisneglected,orm ay representH ubbard states ifH C oulom b is taken to include short-range H ubbard-like interactionsbetween electrons.

T he electrom agnetic vectorpotentialcan be expanded into Fourier m odes A^(ri) = P q e <sup>i</sup><sup>q</sup> <sup>r</sup>iA^<sup>q</sup> . In second quantized notation, the electrom agnetic eld operator takes the form (M ahan,2000)

$$\mathbf{\hat{y}}^{\mathrm{d}} = \underbrace{\mathbf{\hat{n}}^{\mathrm{d}} \mathbf{\hat{n}}^{\mathrm{d}}}\_{\mathbf{h} \mathbf{c}^{\mathrm{d}}} \mathbf{\hat{g}}^{\mathrm{d}} \mathbf{a}^{\mathrm{d}} + \mathbf{e}^{\mathrm{d}} \mathbf{a}^{\mathrm{d}}\_{\mathbf{h}} \mathbf{b} \tag{10}$$

w ith V the volum e and a y <sup>q</sup> ;a<sup>q</sup> are the creation, annihilation operators of transversal photons w ith energy ~!<sup>q</sup> = ~cjqjhaving a polarization direction denoted by the com plex unit vector^eq.

Electronic R am an scattering m easures the totalcross section for scattering from allthe electrons illum inated by the incident light. T he dierential cross section is determ ined by the probability that an incident photon !<sup>i</sup> is scattered into a solid-angle intervalbetween and + d and a frequency w indow between ! <sup>s</sup> and !s+ d!s. A generalexpression for the dierentiallight scattering cross-section isgiven via the transition rateR ofscattering an incident(qi;!i;^e(i) <sup>q</sup> )photon into a outgoing state (qs;!s;^e(s) <sup>q</sup> ),

$$\frac{\text{g}^2}{\text{g}^2 \text{ g} \text{ } \text{l}^{-\text{g}}} = \text{ } \text{-r}\_0^2 \frac{\text{l}}{\text{l}} \text{ } \text{:} \tag{11}$$

H ere, r<sup>0</sup> = e <sup>2</sup>=m c<sup>2</sup> is the T hom pson radius, and R is determ ined via Ferm i's G olden R ule,

$$\mathbf{R} = \frac{1}{Z} \begin{array}{ccccc} \mathbf{I} & \mathbf{A} \\ \mathbf{Z} & \mathbf{j} \end{array} \quad \text{e} \quad \stackrel{\mathbf{E}\_{\mathbf{F},\mathbf{I}}}{\mathbf{j}} \mathbf{M}\_{\mathbf{F},\mathbf{j}\mathbf{I}} \quad \stackrel{\mathbf{J}}{\mathbf{j}} \quad \stackrel{\mathbf{E}\_{\mathbf{F}}}{\mathbf{E}\_{\mathbf{F}}} \quad \stackrel{\mathbf{E}\_{\mathbf{I}}}{\sim} \quad \sim \text{ )}; \tag{1.2}$$

w ith = 1=k<sup>B</sup> T,Z the partition function,and M F ;I = hF jM jIiw here M is the eective lightscattering operator. T he sum represents a therm odynam ic average over possible initialand overnalstatesw ith k vectorsin the solid angle elem entd ofthe m any-electron system having energies EI,E<sup>F</sup> ,respectively. H ere = ! <sup>i</sup> !<sup>s</sup> is the transferred frequency and we denoteq = q<sup>i</sup> q<sup>s</sup> the net m om entum transfered by the photon. M ultiplying Eq.(11)by the incidentphoton 
ux givesthe num berof scattered photons per second into the solid angle increm entd w ithin the frequency ranged! <sup>s</sup>,w hile m ultiplying Eq. (11) by !s=!<sup>i</sup> gives the power scattering cross section (K lein,1983).<sup>5</sup>

From here on we consider the case relevantto R am an scattering in the visible range w ith photon energies of typically 2 eV .Since the m om entum transferred to the electrons,q 1=, w ith the skin depth at the light energies (A brikosov and Fal'kovski,1961),is m uch less than the relevantm om entum scaleoforderk<sup>F</sup> ,theFerm i m om entum in m etallic system s,the lim itq ! 0 isa good approxim ation in practically allcases.<sup>6</sup> H owever,nite q should be considered ifincident light from frequencydoubled or synchrotron radiation is used w here transitions between initialand nalstates at nite q can be probed. T hen the structure ofthe Landau particle-hole continuum in weakly correlated system s or transitions across a nite q M ott gap in strongly correlated insulators can be studied.<sup>7</sup>

M F ;I has contributions from either of the last three term s in Eq. (9): the rst two term s coupling the electron'scurrentto a single photon and the third term coupling the electron'schargeto two photons.T hisisshow n in theschem aticcartoon in Figures3 and 4.H ereweconsider two bands -one partially lled and the other com pletely lled - in w hich the incident photon excites an electron from eitherthe partially orthe com pletely lled band,show n in Figures3 and 4,respectively.In the nonresonant intraband case,the photon gives up part ofits energy to leave behind a particle-hole pair,w hile in the interband case,an interm ediate state is involved,w hich decays via a particle from the partially lled band into the hole left behind in the lled band.

The left panel represents the absorption process moving to a higher energy state, while the right panel illustrates the emission process, where the state returns to a lower energy through photon emission. This diagram is essential for understanding energy exchange dynamics in photonic processes and their applications in both theoretical and practical contexts.

## 2. Im portance of Light Polarization

At this point, little progress can be m ade in evaluating the m atrix elem ents for R am an scattering w ithout specifying the quantum num bers of the electronic m any-body states. Yet, from Eq. (13), one can apply symmetry argum ents to view what types of excitations can be created by the incident photons. In this subsection, we employ a general set of sym m etry classi cations and put speci c em phasis on m odels in later subsections.

The rst term in Eq. (13) only arises ifthe incident and scattering polarization light vectors are not orthogonal, as electronic charge density uctuations are created and destroyed along the polarization directions of the incident and scattered photons. Thus, for instance, this term does not probe electron dynam ics in which the charge density relaxes in a direction orthogonalto the incident polariza-

These diagrams provide essential insights into particle interaction dynamics and their role in inelastic light scattering processes, integral for theoretical studies of superconductivity and quantum mechanics.


FIG . 6 Fevnm an diagram s contained in the cross-section. (a) qives a renom alized photon propagator in the solid, while (b)-(d) vanish due to parity and thus (a)-(d) do not contribute to inelastic light scattering. Of the rem aining contributions, (e) refers to intra-band (som etim es \non-resonant") scattering within a single band, (f) and (g) are referred to as \m ixed" contributions while (h)-(j) describe transitions within a single or between di erent bands via interm ediate band states. If the light energy is equal or close to the energy di erence of the states involved resonance e ects with a strong enhancem ent of the cross section occur. Therefore the contributions them selves are som etim es referred to as \resonant".

tion direction.

In the limit of sm all m om entum transfer q ! 0, the m atrix elem ent sim pli esto ; (q ! 0) = ; and thus this term gives rise to scattering from uctuations of the isotropic electronic num ber density.

The rem aining term sin Eq. (13) have contributions regardless of photon polarization directions. H ow ever, one can further classify scattering contributions by separating the sum over interm ediate states j i into states w hich share som e quantum num berswith the initialm any-body state, such as band index, and states which do not. Since the photon m om enta are m uch sm aller than the relevant electron m om enta, contributions of the term s where the interm ediate states include the initial states are rough ly a factor of vp =c sm aller than the rst tem in Eq. (13) and can be neglected (P ines and N ozieres, 1966; W ol , 1966). How ever contributions where j i includes higher bands cannot in general be neglected, particularly if the energy of the incident or scattering light lies near the energy of a transition from the initial state Er to an interm ediate state E . T hese term s thus give rise to \m ixed" and \resonant" Ram an scattering.

The polarization dependence of R am an scattering can be generally classi ed using argum ents of group theory. In essence, the charge density uctuations brought about by light scattering are modulated in directions determ ined by the polarizations of the incident and scattered photons. These density uctuations thus have the sym m etry im posed on them by the way in which the light is oriented, and the charge density uctuations obey the sym m etry rules governing the scattering geom etry. This is m anifest in the dependence of the Ram an m atrix ele m ents on the initial and nal ferm ion states. In general, the Ram an m atrix elem ent M F ;I = M + ; = e ; es can be decom posed into basis functions of the irreducible point group of the crystal Loudon, 2005; K lein and D ierker, 1984; M onien and Zawadow ski, 1990; Shastry and Shraim an, 1991)

W hich set of contributes to the sum is determ ined by the orientation of incident and scattered polarization directions. A s an exam ple, if we consider the D 4h group of the tetragonal lattice, as in the cuprates, the decom position can be w ritten as

with 0 the corresponding projected operators and e the light polarizations. This classi cation dem onstrates that there is no m ixing of representations for q = 0, ie. the correlation functions read R ; 0 and there are 6 independent correlation functions, each selected by com binations of polarization orientations.

Following Shastry and Shraim an (1990), we list in Table I som e comm on experim entally used polarization geom etries in relation to the elem ents of the transition rate R selected. O ne observes that a com plete characterization of M can be m ade from a subset of the polarization orientations listed in the table. How ever, additional polarization orientations can be usefiil to calibrate data and com pare sym m etry decom positions from di erent com binations of orientations. For geom etries with polarizations in the (a b) plane in D4h crystals, the irreducible representations cannot be accessed individually and must be separated by proper subtraction procedures. A s a m inim um set, four independent con gurations are required, while additional polarizations may be used for consistency checks.

In addition, we have listed in Table I the representative basis functions louin zone (BZ) harm onics for D 4h space group (Allen, 1976). This directly points out the connection between polarizations and the coupling of light to electrons. By virtue of the k-dependence of the light scattering transition rate, excitations on certain regions of the B Z can be correspondingly projected out by orienting the incident and scattered light polarization vectors. Thus, R am an is one of the few spectroscopic multiparticle probes (the other being inelastic X-ray scattering) able to exam ine charge excitations in di erent regions of the BZ.

For exam ple, as dem onstrated in Figure 7, for crossed polarizations transform ing as B 1g , light couples to charge excitations along the BZ axes (kx or ky = 0), while for B 2g, excitations along the BZ diagonals (Kx = = kg)

are projected accordingly. Operators like OA20 cannot be accessed independently by linear polarizations alone. Only sum s including circular polarizations allow the isolation of A 2g com ponents. Light scattering in this orientation can be coupled to chiral excitations. These in portant sym metry classi cations have been extrem ely useful to point out an isotropic electron dynam ics in correlated insulators (Devereaux et al., 2003a,c; Shastry and Shraim an, 1990), superconductors (Devereaux et al, 1994a), disordered (D evereaux, 1992; Zaw adow ski and Cardona, 1990) and correlated metals (Einzel and M anske, 2004; Freericks and D evereaux, 2001; Freericks et al., 2001). M ore recently they have been related to sum nules referring to BZ-projected potential energies in correlated system s (Freericks et al., 2005). In the rem aining part of this review , such symm etry classi cations w ill be featured prom inently.

# B . Form alism : Single Particle Excitations and W eak Correlations

W e now consider speci c cases where simpli cations can be m ade to Eq. (13). First we assum e that the interm ediate m any-particle states only di er from the initial and nalstates by single electron excitations. This is exact in the limit of non-interacting electrons, yet ignores the e ects of many-body correlations, and speci cally the role of Coulomb interactions on the reorganization of the initial state into the interm ediate states by creating m any-particle excitations. W e now focus on weakly interacting system s, where single-particle excitations are relatively well de ned, and discuss strongly correlated system s in later sections.

The Ram an response S is proportional to S with a constant of proportionality determ ined by the ratio of e ective to free electron m ass.

Inelastic light scattering occurs via the creation of charge uctuations inside the unit cell which are coupled via the Coulom b interaction to charge uctuations in other unit cells. These intercell excitations are therefore well screened by the Coulom b interaction and reduce the scattering cross section at sm allq. In particular, for sm all q, (q; ) = v = v = = 2, and the response is governed by the plasm a frequency. The Ram an response thus obeys the longitudinal sum rule resulting from particle num ber conservation (Pines and Nozieres, 1966),

$$\mathop{\mathbf{L}\_{\mathbf{P}\_{\mathbf{1}}}}\_{\mathop{\mathbf{d}}} \mathop{\mathbf{d}}\_{\mathop{\mathbf{m}}} \quad \mathop{\mathbf{Im}}\_{\mathop{\mathbf{m}}} \quad \mathop{\frac{1}{\underbrace{\mathop{\mathbf{d}}}\_{\mathop{\mathbf{p}}} \mathbf{N}\_{\mathbf{1}}}} \quad = \mathop{\frac{1}{2}}\_{\mathop{\mathbf{2}}} \quad \mathop{\mathbf{s}}\_{\mathop{\mathbf{p}}1}^{2} = \mathop{\frac{2}{\mathbf{m}}}\_{\mathop{\mathbf{m}}} \mathop{\mathbf{s}}\_{\mathop{\mathbf{e}}}^{2}; \tag{28}$$

where p1 is the plasm a frequency and N is the num ber ofelections ofm assm and charge e in the system . Thus the only contribution for q ! 0 com es from exciting the plasm on being the only charge excitation available for light scattering at sm all q in a free-electron gas.

#### 3. Intra-vs. Inter-cell Charge Fluctuations

In the more general case of light scattering in solids, the Ram an response m ay have other contributions com ing from intra-cellcharge uctuations, provided the band structure is non-parabolic, as pointed out by Platzman (1965) and W ol (1968). Then light can create anisotropic charge uctuations which are zero on average inside the unit cell and thus are not screened via the long-range Coulomb interaction, as pointed out by Abrikosov and Genkin (1973). The general expression for the screened Ram an response finction 39, can be w ritten as (Devereaux and Einzel, 1995a; M onien and Zawadow ski, 1990)

$$\mathbf{a}^{\text{act}}\_{\text{act}} = \mathbf{a}^{\text{act}}, \quad \mathbf{a}^{\text{act}}\_{\text{act}} = \mathbf{a}^{\text{act}}\_{\text{act}} + \mathbf{a}^{\text{act}}\_{\text{act}} = \mathbf{a}^{\text{act}}\_{\text{act}} \tag{29}$$

where sc = 1;1 (1 (1 ) { 1;1 ) 1 . T his is an exact expression, where the subscript denotes the e ective R am an density and 1 denotes the pure charge density, obtained when the usually m om entum dependent vertex is replaced by a constant. The respective s describe the full density-density, density R am an density, and R am an density Ram an density susceptibilities which are again each irreducible with respect to the interaction .

The rst term in Eq. (29) is the bare response for a neutral system , and the other term s represent the backow needed to enforce particle num ber conservation of charge density uctuations and gauge invariance. These term s are in portant for light scattering con gurations which transform according to the symm etry of the lattice, such as A 1g in D 4h crystals. In particular, if we consider scattering from pure charge density uctuations where is a constant independent of m om entum , w hich is an A 1g representation, the rst two term s in Eq. (29) cancel and sc and Eq. (27) are recovered. This is inescapable for q = 0, since then the scattering operator is given in term s of the total density of electrons, which commutes with the bare H am iltonian and therefore cannot give inelastic scattering channels to light. On the other hand, if we consider the scattering vertex to depend on wavevector, the back ow term s are not capable of com pletely canceling the bare Ram an response.

M om entum dependence of the vertex is quite general for electrons in solids. In particular, for crossed light polarizations projecting out representations of low er sym m etry than that of the lattice - ;1 is identically zero by symmetry for q = 0 and the back ow term s m ake no correction to the Ram an cross-section. This occurs for B 1g ;B 2g, and Eg scattering geom etries in D 4h system s such as the cuprates, for exam ple. W hile there is

<sup>9</sup> This is derived in A ppendix E of A shcroft and M em in (1976).

no conservation law for light scattering from the excitations created by crossed polarizations (K osztin, 1991), there are sum rules which relate the Ram an intensity to m odel dependent potentialenergies projected in di erent regions of the BZ (Freericks et al., 2005).

#### C. Form alism : Strong Correlations

#### 1. General Approach to Treating Correlations

Section II.B outlined a general approach to inelastic light scattering when the interm ediate states di er from the initial and nal states only by individual single electron energies. This holds in the limit of weakly interacting electrons. In this section we show that the form alism is also valid in the Heisenberg limit of the Hubbard m odel including the manifold of zero and 1 doubly occupied sites. These are two limits in which either the kinetic energy or the potential energy of the electrons is dom inant. How ever, the m ore general case of interest to m ost system s is tackling the problem when both kinetic and potential energies are roughly equal. The interactions are su cient to give broad spectral finctions as m easured by ARPES, where the incoherent part of the spectral function is m an ifest from the strong m any-body interactions m ixing individual electron states.

In this situation, one must resort back to E q. (13), and correlation functions involving two, three and four particles are needed, as depicted in Figure 6. Yet usually one is not interested in treating m any-body correlations over various bands and puts focus on a few bands close to the Ferm i level having strong correlations. For exam ple in the cuprates, one usually takes downfolded H am iltonians involving only Cu 3dx2 , 2 and 0 2px;y orbitals, with short-range Coulomb interactions for two electrons in on site or neighboring orbital states. The down folding procedure, such as that described by Low din (1951), rem oves all other bands (e ectively m oving them in nitely far away in energy from the focus bands), such as the apicaloxygen, Cu 4s and other Cu d orbitals, and treats the electrons in the bands of interest as having renorm alized energy dispersion. In the cuprates the downfolding results in either a few bands from local density approxim ation (LD A ) approaches in one case or cellperturbation theory in the strongly interacting case. Thus we consider a downfolded tight-binding H am iltonian

$$\mathbf{H}\_{\bullet} = \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{H} \\ \mathbf{H}\_{\bullet} \mathbf{j}\_{\bullet} \mathbf{C}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}} \mathbf{C}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}} \mathbf{C}\_{\mathbf{j}\mathbf{j}} \mathbf{j} + \mathbf{H}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}\mathbf{i}} \mathbf{j} \end{array} \tag{30}$$

where tij; are the e ective hopping integrals resulting from the downfolding procedure, and H int describes the relevant interactions. For example, we m ay consider a square lattice of electrons with strong on-site repulsion U m uch greater than the electron hopping t in the Hubbard m odel,

$$\mathbf{H} = \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{X} \\ \mathbf{t} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{C} \\ \mathbf{C}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{C}\_{\mathbf{j}} \\ \mathbf{C}\_{\mathbf{j}} \\ \end{array} + \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{X} \\ \mathbf{U} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{X} \\ \mathbf{n}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}} \\ \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{n}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}} \\ \mathbf{n}\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{j}} \\ \end{array} \tag{31}$$

where hi; ji denotes a sum over nearest neighbors.

The electronic eigenstates fall into two bands for large U at 1/2 lling -e.g., the occupied low er and unoccupied upper Hubbard bands - separated by an energy U for double occupancies. A w ay from 1/2 lling, quasiparticles develop. The m icroscopic H am iltonians can be viewed as fam ilies of models related to the Hubbard model, such as the Falicov-K im ballm odel, Anderson m odel, or Anderson Fano model, w ithout loss of generality.

In essence, the sum s over interm ediate states in E q. (13) are separated into groups of bands lying far away in energy from the initial and nalstates (i.e. the bands projected out) and bands lying nearby the initial and nal states (considered bands with correlations). The form er grouping of interm ediate states are considered as in Section IIIB to be approxim ated by the e ective m ass contribution, Eq. (24). The rem aining term s involve m atrix elem ents of the current operator between the rem aining band of interest10 .

The interaction of light with these down folded electrons can be treated via the P eier's construction, in w hich the creation and annihilation operators develop a phase,

$$\mathbf{c\_{i}} \quad ! \quad \mathbf{c\_{i}} \quad \oplus \quad \stackrel{\mathbf{i\_{r\_{c\_{i}}}}}{\stackrel{\mathbf{n}}{\longrightarrow}} \quad ! \quad \stackrel{\mathbf{n\_{r\_{i}}}}{\stackrel{\mathbf{n}}{\longrightarrow}} \quad \tag{32}$$

The resulting scattering Ham iltonian obtained by expanding in powers of A reads

$$\mathbf{H} \text{ int} = \frac{\mathbf{e}}{\gamma \mathbf{c}} \mathbf{\hat{j}} \quad \mathbf{A} \xrightarrow[2\gamma^2 \mathbf{c}^2]{\mathbf{A}} \quad \mathbf{A} \quad \mathbf{\hat{A}} \quad \mathbf{A} \quad \mathbf{j} \tag{33}$$

where

$$\mathbf{C} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{d} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{x} \\ \mathbf{d} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{g} \text{ "\(\mathbf{k}\)} \\ \mathbf{c} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{g} \text{ "\(\mathbf{k}\)} \\ \mathbf{c} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{g} \text{ "\(\mathbf{k}\)} \\ \mathbf{c} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{g} \text{ "\(\mathbf{k}\)} \\ \mathbf{c} \end{array} \begin{array}{c} \mathbf{g} \text{ "\(\mathbf{k}\)} \end{array} \tag{34}$$

is a com ponent of the current operator j and

$$\mathbf{x} \quad \text{(d)} = \int\_{\mathbb{R}^{k}} \underbrace{\Phi^{2} \mathbf{n} \otimes \mathbf{k}}\_{\text{(\\$ k \text{ (\\$ k \text{)}}\$ for \\$ k)}} \mathbf{c}^{\text{V}} \otimes \mathbf{k} + \mathbf{q} \mathbf{e} \mathbf{2} \otimes \mathbf{k} \qquad \text{(\\$ k \text{)}}$$

is the stress tensor operator. Both operators are thus form ed from the energy dispersion of the downfolded band structure. The m atrix elem ent can be written in com pact form :

$$\mathbf{M} \quad \text{ (d)} = \mathbf{H} \mathbf{J} \quad \text{\(d)} \text{ j.r.t.} \quad \text{ (e)}$$

$$\mathbf{M} \quad \text{ (f)} \quad \text{ (g)} \quad \text{ (h)} \quad \text{ (h)}$$

<sup>10</sup> We rem ark that this is not exact as it inaccurately treats resonant scattering processes occurring w ithin the conduction band . Since these processes are usually taken to be dam ped, even though this approach is strictly speaking not exact, it provides a good starting point for considering R am an scattering in correlated singleband system s, and as such, has been widely used (Shastry and Shraim an, 1991).

with the sum over interm ediate states of the H am iltonian E q. (30). The R am an cross section can be separated into non-resonant, m ixed, and resonant contributions:

$$\mathcal{R}\_{\parallel}(\cdot) = \mathcal{R}\_{\perp \parallel}(\cdot) + \mathcal{R}\_{\perp \parallel}(\cdot) + \mathcal{R}\_{\perp \parallel}(\cdot);\tag{37}$$

where the nonresonant contribution is

$$\mathbb{R}\_{N} \quad \{\cdot\} = \mathop{\mathbf{x}}\_{\mathbb{T}, \mathbb{R}} \quad \mathop{\mathbf{e}}\_{\mathbb{T}, \mathbb{R}} \quad \mathop{\mathbf{z}}\_{\mathbb{T}, \mathbb{R}} \sim\_{\mathbb{R}} \mathop{\mathbf{z}}\_{\mathbb{T}, \mathbb{R}} \quad \mathop{\mathbf{z}}\_{\mathbb{T}, \mathbb{R}} \quad \mathop{\mathbf{e}}\_{\mathbb{T}, \mathbb{R}} \quad \mathbb{E}\_{\mathbb{T}} \quad \sim \mathbf{1}; \mathbf{y};$$

the m ixed contribution is

$$\begin{array}{ccccc} \text{R}\_{\text{M}} \text{ (\cdot)} & = & \overset{\text{X}}{\text{E}} & \underbrace{\exp \text{ (\cdot)} \text{ E}\_{\text{I}}}\_{\text{I}} \\ & & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & & \\ & & & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} \\ & & & & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} \\ & & & & & & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & \overset{\text{1.25}}{\text{E}} & & & & & \\ & & & & & & & & & \text{1.25} & \\ & & & & & & & & & & \text{1.25} & \\ & & & & & & & & & & & \end{array} \end{array}$$

and denote Ó ; as the m atrix elem ent h the contributions are depicted diagram m atically in Figures 8, 9, and 10 for the non-resonant, the m ixed, and the resonant term s, respectively. In the limit D ! 1 these are the m ain diagram s to consider. A dditional diagram s involving multi-particle vertex renorm alizations generally contribute for nite dimensions (not shown).

In general, the matrix elements that enter into Eqs. (38{40) are not easy to calculate for an interacting system , so the summ ations are problem atic to evaluate.

In particular, one needs to evaluate the irreducible stress and current vertices, depicted in Figures 8-10 by the hatched sym bols. C ontributions to these vertex dressings include m any-particle renorm alizations. A particularly com plicated one is shown in Figure 11 which represents 4-particle vertex corrections. M oreover, analytic continuation must be perform ed to obtain the Ram an response R ( ) on the realaxis from the im aginary axis. W hile this is relatively straightforward for the non-resonant case, m ixed and resonant cases are problem atic because of the com plicated dependences on each of the frequencies ! i;s; which have to be analytically continued. W hile the continuation has been worked out recently for the general case, evaluating these diagram s for general interactions has proved elusive.

The overall.com plexity of the problem limits the evaluation of the light scattering cross section to generic interacting system s. O nly recently, these diagram s have been evaluated exactly in a DM FT treatm ent of the Falicov-K im ballm odel (Shvaika et al, 2004, 2005) .

W e note that the polarization dependence is crucialas well. For xx + yy polarizations projecting the fully sym m etric com ponents,the lightscattering H am iltonian com m utes w ith the nearest neighbor H eisenberg H am iltonian and thus does not give inelastic scattering in the A1<sup>g</sup> channel.M oreover,B <sup>2</sup><sup>g</sup> (xy)isalso identically zero. A s a result,a large signalappears only in the B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> channel (xx yy). T hese restrictions are lifted however if longer range spin interactions are considered (Shastry and Shraim an,1991).

T he collapse ofthe interm ediate states allowed us to replace the operatorsw ith projected spin operatorscon ned to the restricted H ilbertspace ofthe n = 0;1 m anifolds.T hus,in thislim ited H ilbertspace,the form alism is sim ilar to non-interacting electrons in that the operatorsappearing in thescattering m atrix m ay besim plied. If the H ilbert space is enlarged to include larger m anifolds, then this would no longer be the case, and thus including term s to higher order in t=U becom es highly non-trivialand is stillone ofthe challenges to m erge a weakly interacting pictureinto a strongly interacting one.

W e note that Equation (46) was derived eectively as an expansion in t=(U ~!i). T herefore,the scattering H am iltonian is lim ited to cases w hen both the num ber ofholesand double occupied sites are restricted and o resonance conditionsapply,w ith the incidentphoton energy ~!<sup>i</sup> far away from U . Eorts to extend the treatm ent to m ore generalconditions involve understanding the m otion of holes or doubly occupied sites in an arbitrary spin background. T his has proved to be a hard task.

In Sections II.B and II.C we reviewed the generalform alism of the theory of R am an scattering for weakly and strongly correlated system s. In this subsection we

now specify the electronic statesfrom w hich lightcan be scattered and review the various theoreticaltreatm ents for specic m odels ofinteracting electrons. Em phasis is placed upon how sym m etry can beused to highlightelectron dynam icson regionsofthe BZ,and generalfeatures for each m odelsystem w illbe presented. W e rst considerthe case w here the correlationsam ong electronsare weak.

## 1. W eakly-Interacting Electrons

In thissubsection,weconsiderelectronsashaving very welldened eigenstates labeled by energy and m om entum and having sharp spectral functions. A part from the form of the energy dispersion <sup>k</sup> , the results are rather generaland governed largely by phase space considerations. W e m ust,however,consider the long-range C oulom b interaction in orderto accountforchargeback ow and screening,and we utilize the results derived in Section II.B and the generalexpression Eq.(29).

T he use of sc rather than takes into account the m ost drastic m anifestation of the long-range C oulom b interaction,viz. screening. For weakly interacting electrons, the R andom Phase A pproxim ation (R PA ) is acceptable, w hich replaces sc by the Lindhard function fornon-interacting electrons.T he response functionsare determ ined by the Lindhard kernel,

$$\mathbf{A}\_{\text{a,bp}}(\mathbf{q};\mathbf{y}) = \sum\_{\mathbf{k}} \mathbf{x}\_{\text{a,pb}} \mathbf{p}\_{\text{b,p}} \frac{\mathbf{f}\_{\text{b,p}} \mathbf{f}\_{\text{b,p}}}{\mathbf{x}\_{\text{a,bp}} + \mathbf{y}\_{\text{a,p}}}, \quad \mathbf{f}\_{\text{b,p}}(\mathbf{q};\mathbf{y}) = \mathbf{x}\_{\text{a,bp}}$$

for generalverticesa;b appearing in Eq.(29). In a free electron gas, the R am an response is given by Eq.(27) or equivalently, the last term in Eq.(29). For large q, collective excitations are unim portant and light scattering occursvia creation ofparticle-hole excitationsin the Landau continuum . H owever, as the only phase space
for creating particle-hole pairs com es from nite q transferred from the photons, the resulting response is a continuum varying linearly with at sm all frequencies and extending up to a cut-o the continuum (M ahan, 2000). The low-energy intensity is proportional to q , and the only excitation left at q = 0 is the collective plasm on. The Ram an response for the free electron gas is shown in Figure 12.

For electrons in a solid, how ever, the non-parabolicity of the energy dispersion results in charge uctuations which are anisotropic in the sm all q limit and thus can survive screening and give m ore weight at low energy transfers. Form ally, an additional contribution to the response is given by the rst two term s in Eq. (29). Yet phase space restrictions still produce an inescapable cuto at that shown in Figure 12. This is also the case if scattering occurs for the 2 dim ensional electron-gas (2D E G ) in the absence of a m agnetic eld (Jain and Das Sam a, 1987; M ishchenko, 1999) or for com plex Ferm i surfaces (Ipatova et al, 1983). An RPA treatment for resonant scattering has been given by W ang and D as Sarm a (1999, 2002).

Recently, substantial progress has been m ade in understand.ing the Ram an response in the integer or fractional quantum Hallregim es ofthe 2D EG . Space lim itations do not allow us to review these system s; so for brevity, we cite only a recent reference (R ichards, 2000) .

# 2. Impurities

Excitations at low energies in non-interacting electronic system s can arise for sm all q via electronic scattering from in purities, where m om entum contributed by im purity scattering can provide phase space for electronhole creation which is anisotropic in the Brillouin zone. For exam ple, if one considers a general electron-im purity

H ere we start by considering non-resonant scattering, since this is an area in w hich by far m ost theoretical treatm ents lie, as it is sim pler to evaluate than the m ixed or resonant term s. W e note that m any calculationsofIm (1=)have been perform ed from ab-initio approachesin the contextofinelastic X -ray scattering (see G urtubay et al.(2004) and references therein for recent work). T here,the focus is largely on the q dependence ofthe response,and electron-electron interactions have been treated in various ways (K u et al.,2002). Yet,to our know ledge,no calculation exists for R am an scattering in a sim ple Ferm iliquid in w hich inelastic scattering processes via the C oulom b interaction are incorporated exactly,although recently dynam icalm ean eld theory (D M FT ) in correlated m etals has been used (Freericks and D evereaux,2001). T his is because the irreducible charge vertex is not generally know n in m odels w ith strong correlations, w ith the exception of the Falicov-K im ballm odel. T hus we focus m ore on the polarization dependenceand investigatecontributionsto R am an scattering from non-conserved charge 
uctuations.

T he generalexpression forthe two-particle correlation function describing the non-resonant R am an response reads

$$\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B} = \mathbf{0} \text{ 'i } \mathbf{j} = \sum\_{\mathbf{k}} \mathbf{X} \times \mathbf{X} \text{ 'k } \sum\_{\mathbf{k}} \mathbf{X} \text{ 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{' 'k } \mathbf{j} \text{'$$

Sim ilar expressions are obtained for ;<sup>1</sup> and <sup>1</sup>;<sup>1</sup> w here the vertices are successively replaced by 1 to be inserted into Eq.(29),or m ay be generally represented in term s ofthe reducible R am an vertex as show n in Figure 8. In the ladder approxim ation,the renorm alized vertex is given by a Bethe-Salpeter equation:

(k;i!;i )= (k)+ 1 V  X i! <sup>0</sup> X k0 V (k k <sup>0</sup>;i! i!0)G (k <sup>0</sup>;i!0)G (k <sup>0</sup>;i!0+ i )(k <sup>0</sup>;i!0;i ): (53)

H ere,V (k;!) is the generalized electron-electron interaction, and we have suppressed spin notation. If one neglects vertex corrections such that the theory is not gauge invariant,the R am an response has a particularly sim pleform given by Eq.(3).T heeectofthelong-range C oulom b interaction istreated form ally in the sam e way asin Eq.(29),w ith the verticesreplaced by the norm alized vertex as a solution to the Bethe-Salpeter Eq.(53).

Eqs. (52) and (53) have been the starting point for m any studiesoflightscattering treating electron-electron interactions in eective m odels. T hese include system s

w hich have nearly nested Ferm i surface segm ents (V irosztek and R uvalds, 1991, 1992) or antiferrom agnetic spin 
uctuations (D evereaux and K am pf,1999;K am pf and Brenig, 1992). Sim ilarly, a slave boson approach to the t J m odel (Bang, 1993), electron-phonon interactions(Itai,1992;K ostur,1991,1992;R ashkeev and W endin,1993) and 
uctuation-exchange (FLEX ) treatm ents of the H ubbard m odel(D ahm et al.,1999) have been considered. W hile these studies involve approxim ate solutions,m ore recently the use ofD M FT hasprovided exact results in the lim it ofstrictly localcorrelations in the Hubbard (Freericks et al., 2001, 2003a) and Falicov-K im ballm odels (Freericks and D evereaux, 2001).

Two aspects of the Ram an response are generally in the main focus: the frequency dependence of the broad continuum extending well past qvF , and the polarization dependence. W e discuss rst the spectral response.

In the context of the cuprates, Varm a and coworkers pointed out that a at, nearly frequency independent response could be obtained if the im aginary part of the electron self-energy depended linearly on frequency (Varma et al, 1989a; Varm a, 1989b). The response is then given in term s ofthe scale-invariant ratio of ~ ! =kB T and approaches a constant at large frequency transfers. This can be understood phenom enologically by replacing 1= r w ith 1= f ( ;T ) / m ax (k g T ;~ ) in E q. (49) .11 A scale-invariant response at low frequencies is a general consequence of system s in proxim ity to a quantum critical point, but this scale invariance is broken outside the quantum critical regime. \M arginal Ferm i liquid" behavior em erges for instance when scattering is considered in a nested Ferm i liquid (V irosztek and Ruvalds, 1991, 1992), low Fermirenergy system s (Dahm et al, 1999; D evereaux and K am pf, 1999), and slave-boson system s (Bang, 1993). A broad background very sim ilar to \m arginal" behavior is also found for strongly coupled electron-phonon system s (Itai, 1992; K ostur, 1991, 1992) . A s a representative exam ple, we show the response calculated by V irosztek and Ruvalds (1992) for a nested Ferm i liquid in Figure 14.

In system swith isotropic interactions, the polarization dependence drops out and the slope of the low -frequency Ram an response is given in term s the low energy quasiparticle scattering lifetime, (T) / ~= (T ), as an extension of Eq. (49). Yet, in strongly correlated system s, the quasiparticle residue Z and, im portantly, vertex corrections, enter as well. In a correlated or a strongly disordered m etal (near an Anderson transition, e.g.), how ever, a nite energy m ight be necessary to m ove an electron from one site to another one. Thus, in spite of a nonvanishing density of states at the Ferm i level, as observed in an ARPES experim ent for instance, no current can be

### 4. Interacting Electrons -ResonantResponse

In addition to the non-resonantresponse,one has the m ixed and resonant contributions to consider. Typically thesediagram sareneglected in theweak correlation lim it,as they can be sum m ed into two-particle response functions as discussed in Section II.B. In the insulating case,only the resonantterm sare kept,asthe studies focus on excitations across a charge-transfer or H ubbard gap.T his has been calculated in system s exhibiting 1D - Luttinger behavior (K ram er and Sassetti,2000;Sassetti and K ram er,1998;Sassettietal.,1999;W angetal.,2004) w here bosonization techniques can be applied. Yet,generally treating alldiagram son equalfooting istechnically dem anding.O nly recently,an exactevaluation in D M FT has been perform ed (Shvaika etal.,2004,2005).

It is wellknow n that m any of the R am an signals in correlated m etals and insulatorsdisplay com plicated dependences on incom ing photon frequency !i. For exam ple,the B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> two-m agnon feature at roughly 350 m eV in the thoroughly studied insulating parent cuprates has a resonanceforincidentphoton energiesnear3 eV .A sa reaction to the experim entalresults in the cuprates,m uch theoreticalwork has been devoted to R am an scattering in a two-dim ensionalH eisenberg antiferrom agnet using the Fleury-Loudon m odelEq.(46).

In the nearest neighbor H eisenberg antiferrom agnet, one treatsthe spin operatorsusing a D yson-M aleev representation ofm agnons w ith dispersion 2J. D ue to the B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> form factor,in the absenceofm agnon-m agnon interactionsatT = 0,a sharp peak at4J appearsasthe top of the m agnon dispersion isprojected out,and the response abruptly drops to zero for large R am an shifts (Sandvik etal.,1998).H owever,since the lightscattering islocalized to neighboring spins,m agnon-m agnon interactions m ustbeincluded,and thepeak becom esm oresym m etric and shiftsto 3J via breaking exchange bondsbetween localneighbors,as show n in Figure 17.

**Caption:** Figure 0 illustrates the B1g, B2g, and A1g Raman response of a high-Tc superconductor across varying frequencies normalized to t. The response functions are vital for understanding the symmetry properties of the superconducting gap. The graph shows a steady increase in response as frequency increases, indicative of energy-dependent changes that are crucial for mapping out electron-phonon interactions and uncovering the symmetry of the underlying superconducting order parameter.


FIG . 19 Ram an response in the 1/2- lled Falicov-K im ball m odel (U = 2t) as a function of transfered frequency for various tem peratures for xed incident photon frequency ! i = 2t. The thickest curve is T=t = 0:05, and the tem perature increases to 02, 0.5, and 1 as the curves are m ade thinner. From Shvaika et al. (2004) .

incident photon frequency is slightly larger than the frequency of the non-resonant feature. The resulting R am an response is a com plicated function of the correlations, the tem perature, the incident photon energy, and the transfered energy. It was found that resonance e ects are different in di erent scattering geom etries, corresponding to di erent symm etries of the charge excitations scattered by the light.

Resonance e ects were found as a function of both the incom ing and the outgoing photon frequencies ! i;s . A double resonance - occurring when the energy denom inators of two pairs of the Greens finctions, appearing in the bare response shown in Figure 10, approach zero - gives the strongest resonant enhancem ent of the response(Shvaika et al, 2004). In addition, an interesting resonance e ect on both the charge transfer peak and the low-energy peak was found when the incident photon frequency is of the order of the interaction strength, show ing that in general the total response cannot be well described as a uniform resonance enhancem ent of the separable non-resonant response. In agreem ent with the resuits of Tohyam a et al. (2002), for an antiferrom agnetic system this is a direct consequence of the inseparability of energy scales in the correlated electron problem , in

contrast to non-interacting electrons.

Shown in Figure 19 is the tem perature and sym m etrydependent Ram an response, including non-resonant, resonant, and m ixed term s in the Falikov-K im ball m odel. In the insulating phase, spectral weight is depleted for sm all energy transfers and piles up into the excitations at energies of order U as the tem perature is low ered. The transfer of spectral weight from low er to higher energies occurs across a tem perature independent so-called isosbestic point. An isosbestic point also appears in studies ofthe Hubbard m odel (Freericks et al., 2001, 2003a), im plying that it is a generic feature of the insulating phase, regardless of the m icroscopic origin of the phase. W e note that isosbestic behavior already appears in the nonresonant contributions for B1g scattering. In the A1g and B2g symm etries, it em erges only if resonant term s are included.

The local treatm ent of self energies in the single site DMFT approach imposes lim itations on the theory of light scattering in correlated system s. In particular, the full polarization dependence of the R am an spectra would uncover the way in which correlations a ect electron dynam ics in regions of the BZ, providing a two-particle com plem ent to ARPES, for exam ple. P rogress here m ost likely will come from cluster dynam ical mean eld the ory able to treat nonlocal and anisotropic interactions in a coarse-grained m anner.

## 6. Superconductivity

A s discussed in Section IID .1, in the absence of interactions, there is no phase-space for low energy Ram an scattering for q = 0 m om entum transfers. In the superconducting state, phase space restrictions are lifted since light can break q = 0 Cooper pairs if the energy of the light is greater than 2 . Thus the Ram an response becom es non-trivial, yet easily form ulated, in BCS theory. A s a consequence, there has been an enorm ous am ount of theoretical work devoted to light scattering for tem peratures below To as an extension of the theory for noninteracting electrons in the norm alstate. W e review that work here.

In the superconducting state, focus has been traditionally placed on the tw o-particle non-resonant response in BCS theory. Form ally the Ram an response is given by generalizing Eqs. (52-53) in particle-hole space using Paulim atrices == 0::3 in Nam bu notation (Nam bu, 1960) :

$$\mathbf{(d} = \mathbf{0}; \mathbf{i} \ ) = \sum\_{\mathbf{k} \in \mathbb{Z}^\*} \mathbf{X} \times \mathbf{X} \quad \text{(k)}\\ \mathbf{\hat{S}} \ (\mathbf{k}; \mathbf{i} \ )^\ast (\mathbf{k}; \mathbf{i} \ ) \stackrel{\scriptstyle \mathbf{i}}{\in} \mathbf{X} \quad \text{(k)}\\ \mathbf{\hat{S}} \ (\mathbf{k}; \mathbf{i} \ ) \stackrel{\scriptstyle \mathbf{i}}{\in} \mathbf{X} \quad \text{(k)}$$

where T r denotes the trace, and

$$\mathbf{A}^{\uparrow}(\mathbf{k};\mathbf{i}\mathbf{l};\mathbf{i}\mathbf{l}') = \mathbf{A}^{\uparrow}(\mathbf{k}) + \frac{1}{\mathbf{V}} \sum\_{\mathbf{i}\mathbf{l}'\geq\mathbf{k}^{\uparrow}} \mathbf{X}^{\uparrow}(\mathbf{k}) \mathbf{x}^{\uparrow}\mathbf{k}' \mathbf{i}\mathbf{l}' \mathbf{i} + \mathbf{i}\mathbf{l}'^{\uparrow}\mathbf{j}' \mathbf{i} \mathbf{l}' \mathbf{i} \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{k}\_{0} \mathbf{i}' \mathbf{i} \mathbf{l}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{i} \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{i} \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{i} \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{i} \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}' \mathbf{j}$$

Here the bare Ram an vertex of coupling to charge is ^ = the vertex corrections. For example Vi= 3 corresponds to interactions coupling electronic charge, while Vi= 0 corresponds to spin interactions.

Forthe case ofweak correlations, the G reen's functions appearing in Eqs. (56) and (57) are given by the BCS expression

$$
\hat{G}\_{\uparrow} \not{\mathbb{K}} ; \mathbf{\dot{i}} ! \rangle = \frac{\mathbf{i}! \cdot \mathbf{j}^{\diamond} + \mathbf{k} \, \mathbf{\dot{k}} \, \mathbf{\dot{j}}^{\diamond} + \mathbf{k} \, \mathbf{\dot{k}} \, \mathbf{\dot{k}}^{\diamond}}{\mathbf{i}! \, \mathbf{\dot{k}}^{\diamond} \, \mathbf{\dot{E}}^{2} \, \mathbf{\dot{k}} \, \mathbf{\dot{k}}}; \,\tag{58}
$$

with E 2 (k) = 2 (k) + 2 (k) the quasiparticle energies. In the weak coupling limit for the BCS approxim ation, Vi= 3 = V for phonon-m ediated pairing.

By far, the superconducting state has received the largest am ount of attention from theory, starting from the sem inal contribution of Abrikosov and Fallkovski (1961), which predated the observation of the e ect by 19 years. The m ain focus in the early years was to study the 2 features in conventional s wave superconductors with small and large coherence lengths (A brikosov and Fal'kovski , 1961, 1987; Abrikosov and Falkovsky, 1988; K lein and D ierker, 1984), including the e ects of Coulomb screening (Abrikosov and Genkin, 1973) and exam ining the tem perature dependence (T illey, 1972). If one neglects vertex corrections, the q-dependent R am an response in a superconductor is given by a pro jected M aki-T suneto function (M akiand T suneto, 1962),

with the coherence factors A for q = 0 which sim pli es to

$$\mathbf{A}\_{\text{a,b}}^{\text{in}} \begin{array}{ccccc} \text{map} & \text{b} & \text{m} & \text{m} \\ & & & \text{m} & \text{b}\_{\text{b}} \mathbf{b}\_{\text{b}} & \sum\_{\mathbf{E}} \text{\{\!\!\&k\}} & \text{2\!\!\&k} \\ & & & & \text{E} & \text{\{\!\!\&k\}} \end{array} \\ \begin{array}{ccccc} & & & \text{E} & \text{\{\!\!\&k\}} \\ & & & \text{2\!\&\m} & \text{1} \\ & & & & \text{2\!\&\m} & \text{k} \\ \hline \end{array} \\ \begin{array}{ccccc} & & & \text{1} \\ & & & \text{2\!\&\m} & \text{k} \\ \hline \end{array} ; \begin{array}{ccccc} & & \text{2\!\&\m} & \text{1} \\ & & & \text{2\!\&\m} & \text{k} \\ \hline \end{array} \tag{60}$$

The full Ram an response, including charge screening, is once again given by Eq. (29), in which the vertices a;b are replaced by the Ram an (a;b = ) and pure charge (a;b= 1) vertices (A brikosov and G enkin, 1973).

For the case of an isotropic gap ( (k) = ) and m om entum transfers q = 0, a threshold and a square-root discontinuity appears at twice the gap edge , re ecting the two-particle density of states. For nite q, the singularity is cut-o due to breaking Cooper pairs with nite m om entum , and the peak is shifted out to frequencies of roughly vp q as in the norm al state (Figure 20). Q ualitatively sim ilar behavior is obtained for disordered s wave superconductors (Devereaux, 1992) in which 1= - (see Eq. (49)) assum es the role of vp q .

Further advances in the theory for conventional s wave superconductors were m ade for energy gaps w ith

sm all anisotropy (K lein and D ierker, 1984), coexistence with charge-density wave order (Balseiro and Falicov, 1980; Littlewood and Varm a, 1981, 1982; Tutto and Zawadow ski, 1992), layered superconductors (A brikosov, 1991), im purities (D evereaux, 1992, 1993), and nal-state interactions (Devereaux, 1993; Devereaux and Einzel, 1995a;K lein and D ierker, 1984;M onien and Zawadow ski, 1990).

W e note in particular that the variation with k of the R am an vertices (k) is coupled to the k-dependence of the energy gap (k) (see, e.g., Eq. (60)), leading to a strong polarization dependence of the spectra. For isotropic s-w ave superconductors, the vertex does not affect the lineshape, and thus the spectrum is polarization independent, apart from an overall prefactor. For this case, a polarization dependence can be generated in BC S

theory by taking into account channel dependent nalstate interactions (B ardasis and Schrie er, 1961) and/or im purity scattering. How ever, for the m ost part this only produces a channel dependence in the vicinity of the gap edge, and thus the main feature of the response is the uniform gap existing for allpolarizations. For anisotropic energy gaps, the sym metry dependence of the spectra is a direct consequence of the k-summ ation (angular averaging), which couples gap and R am an vertex and leads to constructive (destructive) interference if the vertex and the gap have the sam e (di erent) sym m etry.

G enerally, in superconductors with nodes of the energy gap, power-law s in the low frequency and/or tem perature variation of transport and them odynam ic quanti ties em erge, replacing threshold or Amhenius behavior ubiquitous in isotropic superconductors. How ever, due to the averaging over the entire Ferm i surface, the pow erlaw sthem selves do not uniquely identify the ground state sym metry of the order param eter, but only can give the topology of the gap nodes along the Ferm i surface, e.g., whether the gap vanishes on points and/or lines. Thus, one cannot distinguish between di erent representations of the energy gap which have the sam e topology. For instance, for the case ofd-w ave tetragonalsuperconductors, there are ve pure representations which have line nodes on the Ferm isurface. Two-particle correlation functions, determ ining the density, spin or current responses, do not have the freedom to probe various portions of the gap or its phase around the Ferm i surface.

W ith the advent of high-T cuprates, a urry of activity ensued on theory of R am an scattering in d wave superconductors (Falkovsky, 1990; M onien and Zawadow ski, 1989), speci cally including polarization depen-

perconducting to the norm alstate is not straightforw ard. As can be seen directly from Eq. (60), the intensity vanishes proportional to 2 as T approaches To. Hence, to avoid phase space lim itations in the absence of C ooper pairs, an additional source for electronic scattering, such as the one m ediating the form ation of C ooper pairs, m ust be included. W hile strong coupling extensions of R am an scattering in d wave superconductors have recently been presented (Dahm et al, 1999; Devereaux and Kam pf, 2000; Jiang and Carbotte, 1996), a m erging of the norm aland the superconducting states is poorly understood. This would require a not yet existing m icroscopic description of the form ation of d wave superconductivity from the norm alstate.

# 7. Collective M odes

R am an scattering has the alm ost unique ability to sort out collective m odes of the two-particle response in different sym m etry channels, ow ing to the freedom to independently adjust the two polarization vectors. The collective m ode spectrum one obtains depends upon which interactions are included in Eq. (57). We rst discuss the general consequences based on gauge-invariance and focus on exciton-like modes.

In order to form a fully gauge-invariant theory, the interactions responsible for superconductivity appear not only in G, but m ust also be included as vertex renom alizations . In this way, the Ram an response from pure charge density uctuations in the superconducting state yields the G oldstone m ode from the broken gauge sym m etry - the phase or Anderson Bogoliubov mode (Anderson, 1958; Bogoliubov et al, 1959; N am bu, 1960). In the absence of the long-range C oulom b interaction, this m ode is a soft sound mode, yet the Coulomb interactions - inescapable for q= 0 - push the sound m ode up to the plasm a frequency via the Higgs mechanism . A s a result, particle-num ber conservation is satis ed in the superconducting state and sc (q = 0; ) = 0, independent of whether one considers B loch states (A brikosov and Genkin, 1973; K lein and D ierker, 1984; M onien and Zawadow ski, 1990) or Anderson exact eigenstates of the disordered problem (Devereaux, 1993).

How ever, additionalm odes of excitonic origin m ay appear if one considers further interactions between electrons in clean (Bardasis and Schrie er, 1961) and disordered (Fulde and Strassler, 1965; M aki and T suneto, 1962) conventional superconductors. These excitons appear split o from the continuum at ~ < 2 if the interaction occurs in higherm om entum channels orthogonal to the BCS condensate.

Since Ram an scattering couples to anisotropic charge density uctuations with symmetry selectivity to di erent channels L, the light polarizations can be used to determ ine the exact nature of bound states. Balseiro and Falicov (1980) considered the form ation of a phonon-C ooperpair bound state due to electron phonon coupling

though neglecting channels higher than L = 0. How ever, this mode is canceled by the back ow applying generically to all system s. Finite L exciton form ation in clean and disordered superconductors, and the resulting appearance in Ram an scattering, have been considered explicitly by M onien and Zawadowski (1990) and Devereaux (1993), respectively, bringing the symm etry of the exciton and the polarization dependence to light.

We show in Section III B below that the e ect of nal state interactions can be substantial in strongly coupled conventional superconductors. This dem onstrates the strength of the electron-phonon coupling, not only in general, but also speci cally in channels orthogonal to the ground state. Interestingly, the lattice instability found in som e of these m aterials has the sam e sym m etry as the collective m ode and the electronic states which apparently drive the transition (W eber, 1984) .

For dx2 y 2 superconductors, the collective mode spectra have been investigated thoroughly by D evereaux and Einzel (1995a) and others (D ahm et al, 1998; M anske et al, 1997, 1998; Strohm et al, 1998a; W u and G ri n, 1995a,b). It was shown that the Anderson Bogoliabov m ode appears in A1g channels and m assive m odes can appear in other channels. Since the pair state has only one representation in the D 4h group, m assive collective modes arise when one considers interactions in orthogonal channels. Recently, it has been suggested that the presence of collective modes may allow one to distinguish charge-or spin-m ediated d wave pairing (Chubukov et al., 1999, 2006), highlighting the possible im portance in the context of the cuprates.

Generally, the collective m ode spectrum can be quite diverse in unconventional superconductors. In principle, additional broken continuous sym m etries can exist, such as SO ; spin rotational sym m etry in spin-triplet system s and SO = orbital rotational sym m etry in spin-singlet system s, if the gap does not possess the full sym m etry of the lattice. Furtherm ore, m assive collective m odes can arise ifthe energy gap is degenerate or has an adm ixture of different representations of the point group . The m assive m odes can in principle lie below the gap edge, and can thus be relevant for the low frequency dynam ics of correlation functions. In fact, Ram an-active m odes in spintriplet superconductors such as Sr2Ru0 4 have draw n recent theoretical interest (K ee et al., 2003), although the experim ental challenges are not negligible because of the low To and the related sm all energy gap in these m aterials.

Though very interesting, spin-triplet pairing or spinorbit e ects are rare and more on the exotic side in superconductivity. Competing ground states, how ever, are quite comm on whenever correlation e ects com e into play. This is not at all con ned to the cuprates, but occurs also in, e.g., spin (SDW ) and charge (CDW ) density wave system s. U sually, density-wave form ation with long-range order at least partially suppresses superconductivity such as in 2H - N bSep (see below ). Then, additionalm odes appear as a result of the com petition between C D W ordering and superconductivity,and collective m odes appear as one m odulates either one or both orderparam eters.

Littlewood and Varm a (1981,1982) and Brow ne and Levin (1983)considered a directcoupling between charge density and superconducting gap am plitudes,m odulated for exam ple by a C D W phonon, although this was not specied. T hey obtained an additional\gap" m ode below 2.Yetthism ode wasonly considered in the L = 0 channel, and C oulom b interactions once again rem ove thism ode.Leietal.(1985)considered an eectiveC D W - SC coupling via a phonon and realized thatin anisotropic system s such collective m odes in L 6= 0 channels m ay appear. Finally,T utt}o and Zawadow ski(1992) treated electron-phonon and C D W am plitude-phonon coupling on equalfooting in nite angular m om entum channels, show inggenerally thatthecollectivem odesin thesechannels are unaected by C oulom b screening. T he m odes obtained split o from the gap edge and appear as excitations below the quasiparticle spectrum ,m uch like excitons in sem iconductors. Evidence of m ixed C D W -SC pairing m ay be seen in R am an experim entsvia the presence or absence ofthese m odes. T his has recently been extended by Zeyher(2003)to M gB2,having m ultiple energy gaps on dierent electron bands.

T he collective m ode spectrum of coupled d wave charge density and superconductivity was investigated by Zeyherand G reco (2002)along the linesdeveloped by T utt}o and Zawadow ski(1992)forconventionalC D W and superconducting system s. A s for s wave C D W superconductors,collective m odessplito from the m axim um ofthe gap edge.

Besides the reorganization of A1<sup>g</sup> spectralweight,additionalm odesalterthe B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> spectrum ,as show n in Figure 23.

uctuations suppress long range order. T hen,collective m odes m ay appear as 
uctuation-induced m odes. T he R am an scattering isusually determ ined from A slam azov-Larkin 
uctuation diagram s considered for the conductivity (A slam azov and Larkin,1968). To overcom e the q = 0 phase space lim itations, the R am an response is given by the exchange of two 
uctuations m odes at wavevectors Q <sup>c</sup> and Qc,yielding generally a m ode at energies oftw ice the m ass ofthe 
uctuation propagator. O nce again the polarization dependence can select dierent 
uctuation m odes corresponding to dierent ordering wavevectors coupling to either charge or spin density m odes. T his wasinvestigated forspin (Brenig and M onien,1992)and charge (C aprara et al.,2005) 
uctuations in the norm al state,and fornovelspin resonancesin the superconducting state ofthe cuprates (C hubukov et al.,1999,2006; Venturinietal.,2000).

Lastly,we rem ark that m any other types ofcollective

m odes are possible ifone considers m ore exotic ground states w ith dierent sym m etry classications. For exam ple, a chiral spin liquid has been investigated by K hveshchenko and W iegm ann (1994)in w hich helicalexcitations were conjectured to exist and are in principle m easurable in A2<sup>g</sup> orientations w hich can be projected out via proper sum s ofspectra taken w ith both linearly and circularly polarized light.O therexam plesarem odes induced by m agnetic elds or optical m odes resulting from D zyaloshinskii-M oriya interactions in H eisenberg antiferrom agnets as observed recently in lightly doped La<sup>2</sup> <sup>x</sup> SrxC uO <sup>4</sup>,0 x 0:03 (G ozar et al.,2005b) and discussed by Silva N eto and Benfatto (2005), directly dem onstrating the im portance of spin coupling to the localenvironm ent.

depth of visible light, quence, the mom entum perpendicular to the surface is not conserved, and the transfer q is not given any m ore by the di erence of the vacuum m om enta of the involved photons ki kg but essentially by = = = (4 k ) w ith k the im aginary part of the index of refraction (A brikosov and Fallkovski , 1961;M illset al., 1970). Even in strongly absorbing m aterials with k > 1, 1= =a holds where a is the lattice constant, and the limit of sm allm om entum transfer is still e ective. This introduces a new energy scale ~vp q ~ ~ ~ = w ith y and q being the m agnitudes ofthe Ferm ivelocity and them om entum transfer, respectively. In all considerations, this scale must be put into relation to the other relevant energies, such as the electron scattering rate = in the superconducting state. These apparent academ ic considerations have major im pact on both the observability and the interpretation of electronic spectra.

# A . Elem entalM etals and Sem iconductors

In addition to the sm all scattering volum e due to the absorption of light by free carriers, a parabolic dispersion and a spherical Ferm i surface reduce the cross section of single-electron excitations in metals and degenerate sem iconductors strongly, since in such system s the associated density uctuations are screened by the long-range Coulomb interaction. The few spectra we are aware of have been taken on elem ents with a m ore com plex band structure such as Nb (K lein, 1982a; K lein and Dierker, 1984) or Dy (Klein et al, 1991). In Dy a broad continuum sim ilar to that in the high-T cuprates (Bozovic et al., 1987) is found. In Nb the superconducting state was studied. Due to the low transition tem perature Tc the correspondingly sm allenergy gap (T) and the sm all ratio = with the penetration depth of the light and

the superconducting coherence length (for details see section III B ) the characteristic redistribution of scattering intensity is very hard to observe. The peaks found at 1.8 K in the expected energy range close to 2 (T ) are very weak, and no norm al state spectra have been m easured for com parison (K lein, 1982a; K lein and D ierker, 1984).

In fact, superconductors rather than norm al metals were the main focus in the early days of electronic R am an scattering. Only after the discovery of the cuprates (Bednorz and M uller, 1986), w ith generally com plicated and som etim es very surprising electronic properties, did studies of the norm al state becom e increasingly attractive (see section IV ) .

#### B. Conventional Superconducting Com pounds

Am ong superconductors, intern etallic com pounds like N b3 Sn or V3Si with A 15 structure, can be considered conventional.both above and below To . They are strictly

3D , superconductivity is m ediated by phonons leading to an essentially isotropic swave gap, and correlations are believed to be ofm inor im portance. This does not m ean they are simple. For instance, the Ferm i velocity is very sm all, close to the velocity of sound, and the Ferm i surface is m ulti-sheeted. Su ciently perfect single crystals of N b3 Sn and V 3 Siundergo a structural transform ation from a cubic to a tetragonal lattice at low tem perature. Nevertheless, A 15 com pounds are paradigm s of strongcoupling swave superconductors with a high density of electronic states at E p . M aterials like the borocarbides, M gB2 or 2H - N bSep are certainly more complex and correlations or multiband aspects com e into play.

### 1. A15 com pounds

Superconductivity induced structures close to twice the gap edge were found in mono-crystalline Nb3 Sn (Fig. 24) and V3Si (Dierker et al, 1983; Hacklet al, 1982, 1983; K lein, 1982a) two years after the discovery of gap m odes in 2H - N bSep by Sooryakum ar and K lein (1980) (section III.C ) and after an early but unsuccessful attempt in polycrystalline Nb3Sn by Fraas (1970). For T < T . the scattering intensity is redistributed

**Caption:** Figure 11 demonstrates Raman shift spectra with photon counts per second on the y-axis across various spectral panels (a-d). Each panel represents different sample or environmental conditions, revealing distinct peak positions and spectral intensities. These spectra facilitate the understanding of phononic and electronic interactions, particularly under different experimental setups, contributing to enhanced interpretation of superconducting and electronic phase transitions in the studied materials.


FIG . 24 Raman spectra of N b3 Sn. Lower curves in (a) and (b) are at 40 K and upper curves are at 1.8 K . Data in (c) and (d) are at 1.8 K . Below To = 18 K the intensity at low energies is strongly suppressed with respect to the norm al state. Beyond a threshold of approxim ately 50 cm - a new peak appears. The symm etries are Eg (a, d), T2g (b), E g + A 1g (c top), E g (c m iddle), and A 1g (c bottom ). The A 1g data in (c) are obtained by subtracting the m iddle from the upper curve. All solid lines except for the upper two in (c) are theoretical ts to a broadened M aki-T suneto function (see section IID .6). From Dierker et al. (1983).

T he well-dened peak in E <sup>g</sup> sym m etry follow s the BC S prediction for the tem perature dependence of the gap up to approxim ately 0:85 T<sup>c</sup> (H ackl et al., 1983, 1989). Som ew hat unexpectedly, the peak frequenciesofthe superconductivity-induced featuresdepend on the selected sym m etry (Table II). Independent of m inor dierences in the absolute num bers stem m ing from the data analysis the E<sup>g</sup> peaks are signicantly below those having A1<sup>g</sup> and T2<sup>g</sup> sym m etries. A t rst glance one could think ofa gap anisotropy to m anifest itself. H owever,there is no support from the tunneling resultsw hich ratherindicate the possible gap anisotropy to be opposite in V3Siand N b3Sn and very large orfrom calorim etric studies w hich should track the sm allestgap (Table II).In addition,the shapesofthe R am an spectra are strongly sym m etry dependent in that the E<sup>g</sup> peak is m uch narrower than the others. T he m eaning ofthis anisotropy wasa m atter ofintense discussion.

T he results in A1<sup>g</sup> scattering sym m etry in N b3Sn (D ierker et al., 1983; K lein, 1982a) and later in V3Si (H ackland K aiser,1988a) dem onstrate clearly that the structures below T<sup>c</sup> originate in light scattering from C ooper pairs (Fig.24),since there exist no R am an active excitations at this sym m etry, such as phonons or other bosonic m odes in the A 15 structure from w hich the electrons can borrow intensity. T here is not even an electronic continuum aboveT<sup>c</sup> (see Fig.24 (c)and H ackl and K aiser (1988a)). In spite ofsim ilar band structures and densities ofstatesatthe Ferm ilevel,N (E<sup>F</sup> ),(K lein et al., 1978) the intensities of the m odes are quite different in the two com pounds as is the overallscattering crosssection.Forthisreason,theweak A1<sup>g</sup> m odein V3Si escaped detection fora w hile (H ackland K aiser,1988a). Since there is nothing to interactw ith the peak frequencies,theA1<sup>g</sup> structuresshould be closeto the energy gap in the respective m aterial. O ne actually observes coincidence of both the A1<sup>g</sup> and T2<sup>g</sup> R am an energies w ith those ofbulk m ethodssuch ascalorim etry and neutrons, w hile the E<sup>g</sup> energies are substantially lower(Table II).

W e rst note that surface sensitive m ethods such as tunneling return som ew hat sm aller gap energies than bulk m ethods. O ptical spectroscopy results are also sm aller m ost likely due to surface treatm ent. Strain or disorder can indeed reduce T<sup>c</sup> in A 15 m aterials since N (E<sup>F</sup> ) decreases rapidly (M attheiss and W eber,1982). Sim ilarreasonsm ightapply fortheR am an data in N b3Sn ofD ierkeretal.(1983)although the ts (see Figure 24) revealgap values slightly below (5{10 % ) the peak positions. Spectra ofcleaved surfaces,such as those ofV3Si and N b3Sn taken by H ackland K aiser(1988a)and H ackl etal.(1989),respectively,apparently give gapscloser to the bulk values.

The x-axis denotes the Raman shift in cm^-1, ranging from 30 to 100, while the y-axis represents photon counts per second. The fitted curve demonstrates a peak near the lower Raman shift range that diminishes gradually at higher shifts.

This correlation is crucial for substantiating the provided model in explaining material interactions observed in superconductors like V3Si.

explaining both the reduced energy and the linew idth of the E gap mode M onien and Zawadow ski, 1990). F its to the results in V3Si are substantially im proved by including the bound state (Fig. 25) in com parison to those neglecting it (K lein and D ierker, 1984). A dditional experim ental support com es from the evolution with tem perature of the spectra in V33Siand N b3 Sn (Hacklet al, 1983, 1989). In either com pound, the integrated spectral w eight in A 1g sym m etry increases signi cantly because a new scattering channelopens up below To due to the form ation of C ooper pairs while staying essentially constant in Eg sym m etry because the weight is being transferred from the phonon to the bound state (Fig. 26).

In contrast to E q sym m etry, the pair-breaking features in T2g symmetry are weak and essentially at the A1g position. The question arises as to why there is no bound state although there exists a phonon. Clearly, the T2g phonon intensity is weak and the line width is small, re ecting the m oderate coupling as opposed to E g sym m etry w here the com plete line w idth and the asym m etric Fano shape stem from the coupling to conduction electrons (W eber, 1984; W ipfet al., 1978). The bound state's energy split-o by approxim ately 30 % indicates that the very strong interaction drives the system close to an instability of the s-wave ground state. On the other hand, the T2g m ode is only weakly coupled and the interaction with the conduction electrons is not strong enough to substantially renorm alize the spectrum .

Symmetry argum ents, the unique line shape and the intensity transfer in Eg symmetry, as well as the com parison to calorin etric results, m ake us believe that the form ation of a bound state is m ore likely an interpretation of the Eg results in A 15 com pounds than the m an-

#### 2. M gB 2 and the Borocarbides

Electronic Ram an studies on M gB 2 have explored the superconducting energy gap and changes in phonon lineshapes occurring below To, starting with the work of Chen et al. (2001) and follow ed thereaffer by Q uilty et al. (2002, 2003). Here the symm etry dependence of the response allowed a direct observation of the pairing gap on the two-dim ensional bands and the 3D bands. By orienting the light polarizations along the c-axis ofM gB (perpendicular to the hexagonalplanes) the bands cannot be probed for having little dispersion and thus the bands are projected out, giving a value 2 = = 29 cm 1 . 0 ther polarizations are able to detect a larger pairing gap 2 = 100 cm conducting state are shown in Figure 27 along with ts from the theory for disordered s wave superconductors.

The gap values are consistent with those from other techniques, yet the t y ields values of the disorder-related scattering rate di erent from those of the resistivity by a factor of 2 (Quilty et al., 2003). Zeyher (2003) has reanalyzed the twhere the direct coupling of light to the

band is zero and the gap appears as a result of a coupling to the Ram an active E 2g phonon, believed to be largely responsible for pairing. The xx spectrum in the superconducting state can be understood then as a superposition of a phonon line, a background, and a collective bound state due to residual interactions between electrons, sim ilarto that observed in A 15 com pounds (see Figures 25 and 26 (a)).

The superconducting energy gap has also been stud-

Since a direct coupling to a R am an active m ode was not found in the borocarbides, it is m ore com plicated than in the A 15 com pounds or in M gB<sup>2</sup> to sort out w hether a gap anisotropy, m ulti-gap superconductivity or collective m odes are responsible for the variations in energy and line shape at the dierent sym m etries. O f course, the existence of bound states is not related to R am an-active m odes;only the experim entalverication is m ore indirect,e.g.,via the line shape (see Figure 25). Sim ilarly, the linear low -energy scattering can suggest either the presence ofstrong inelastic scattering due to largecoupling constants (A llen and R ainer,1991;Yang et al.,2000b) or gap nodes in pairing states w ith lower sym m etry,such ass+ g-wavesuperconductivity (Leeand C hoi,2002).A quantitative analysison the basisofa realistic band structure could possibly help clarify these, atpresent,open issues.

### C. Charge D ensity W ave System s

T he com petition or coexistence of dierent ground states was studied intensively in layered dichalcogenides in the 1970s and 1980s. T he interest in these charge density wave (C D W ) system s was revived after the discovery ofsuperconductivity in the cuprates for two reasons: in both com pound classes superconductivity com petesw ith one orm ore otherinstabilities,and,secondly, thedram atically im proved instrum entation allowed qualitatively new and unexpected insightsinto m aterialslike 2H N bSe2. A s an exam ple, the electronic scattering rate <sup>1</sup> exhibits m arginal(Varm a et al.,1989a) rather than Ferm i liquid like tem perature and energy dependences (for a discussion and forreferencessee,e.g.,C astro N eto (2001)).

2H N bSe<sup>2</sup> is a layered, though 3D , superconductor w ith an in-plane coherence length <sup>k</sup> of approxim ately 70 A and ? = 25 A (de Trey et al.,1973).

A s can be seen in all panels, the C D W m ode hardens below the superconducting transition.

T he dierence between the two sam ples is apparently the im purity concentration aecting the strength ofboth the C D W and the gap m ode. In fact,the C D W transition can be suppressed by either pressure or an increasing num ber ofdefects,w hich m ay be quantied by the residualresistanceratio (H untley and Frindt,1974).In a system atic study ofim purity eects,Sooryakum aretal.

This is a prom ising direction for future studies.

### D . Kondo or M ixed-Valent Insulators

A 11 correlations discussed so far are related to electronlattice interactions in system s with screening lengths of the order of the interatom ic spacing. W ith decreasing electronic density, new phenom ena develop originating from the com petition between kinetic and potential energy of the conduction electrons. W ell known examples are the M ott m etal-insulator transition or W igner crystallization. In either case, the material becom es an insulator at low tem perature due to \imm obilization" of electrons rather than an energy gap as in band insulators.

R am an scattering on band insulators and sem iconductors has been well-docum ented, with a focus placed on high energy charge transfer excitations. Yet the developm ent of the Ram an response at low frequencies can in principle shed light on the developm ent of electronic correlations with tem perature and/or doping.

Experim entsby N yhuset al. (1995a) on K ondo insulating FeSishown in Fig. 30 and Nyhus et al. (1995b, 1997a) on m ixed-valent Sm B & have indeed show n the transfer of spectral weight from low to high energies as the tem perature is lowered into the insulating state. This \universality" suggests that there is a comm on m echanism goveming the electronic transport in correlated insulators. A s these m aterials are cooled, they all show a pileup of spectral weight for m oderate photon energy losses with a simultaneous reduction of the low-frequency spectral weight. This spectralweight transfer is slow at high tem peratures and then rapidly increases as the tem perature is low ered tow ards a putative quantum -criticalpoint corresponding to a m etal-insulator transition .

A characteristic energy appears which separates the region of intensity depletion from intensity enhancem ent with tem perature. This characteristic frequency is essentially independent of tem perature and is thus called an isosbestic point in the spectra (as shown in Figure 30). Finally, it is often observed that the range of frequency where the Ram an response is reduced as T is low ered is an order ofm agnitude or m ore larger than the tem perature at which the low-frequency spectral weight disappears. A s discussed in the Section IID .4 these ndings are consistent with the loss of low -frequency scattering due to the them al depletion of excited states. The channel-dependence has not yet been a focus of interest. If it were measured, im portant inform ation concerning the evolution of the potential energy with doping could be inferred (Freericks et al., 2005) .

**Caption:** Figure 6 illustrates the temperature dependence of Raman spectra in FeSi across various energy shifts labeled at 340 K, 175 K, 120 K, 50 K, and 15 K. Significant spectral features that evolve as the temperature decreases provide insights into electronic correlation effects and electron-phonon coupling in semiconductors. This transformation of spectral lines signifies the transition into potential charge density wave ordering or spin density wave features, marking key phases in FeSi under thermal variation.

E . M agnetic, charge and orbital ordering: Ram an scattering in Eu-based com pounds, Ruthenates, and the M anganites.

There has been a great deal of interest in the relationship between diverse and exotic low tem perature phases of strongly correlated system s (Dagotto, 2005). In particular, them anganites, ruthenates, E u-oxides, and hexaborides display charge ordered, param agnetic insulating, and ferrom agnetic m etallic phases as a finction of doping, tem perature, and/or tem perature. Due to the com plex interplay between spin, charge, and orbital degrees of freedom , these system s present a battleground where di erent ordered phases com pete for prim acy as knobs of the H am iltonian are changed (Im ada et al., 1998) .

The phase diagram of strongly correlated m aterials is m ore com plex in system s having strong electron-lattice interactions as well as orbital ordering tendencies. Ram an spectroscopy in system s such as the m anganites and ruthenates have provided important inform ation on the evolution of lattice, charge, and spin dynam ics across phase boundaries. In m any cases the transitions can be induced by applying pressure.

W hile Ram an scattering from phonons has traditionally provided im portant inform ation concerning the developm ent of locally or globally sym m etry-broken states accom panied by the form ation of static charge ordering, electronic R am an spectroscopy can be brought to bear on this problem as it can detect both uctuating or static charge and/or spin ordering, and m ay re ect on the tendency toward ordering as well. In addition, the polarization dependence can shed light on the types ofexcitations that are created in or near the ordered phases which may serve as signatures that certain interactions are m ore prom inent than others. Thus Ram an is a pow -

erful spectroscopic m ethod by which the dynam ics across quantum phase transitions can be investigated in correlated system s.

Recent Ram an studies on EuB & (N yhus et al., 1997b), Eu1 x LaxB 6 , EuO (Snow et al, 2001), and Eu1 x G dx O (Rho et al, 2002), show that the metal-sem iconductor transition in these m aterials is accom panied by distinct changes of the electronic continuum . A high-tem perature param agnetic sem im etallic phase is well characterized by scattering from di usive charge excitations w hich becom e less di usive at lower tem peratures when correlation effects have not yet set in . How ever, the di usive scattering rate, when twith Eq. (49), increases with decreasing tem perature and scales with the m agnetic susceptibility as the system begins to develop short-range m agnetic order, typical of insulating behavior, as show n in F igures 19 and 30. Finally, at low temperatures, a ferrom agnetic m etallic phase occurs, show ing a at continuum characteristic of a strongly correlated metal. The doping, polarization, and m agnetic eld dependence of the spectra im plies that the metal sem iconductor transition is precipitated by the form ation of bound magnetic polarons above the ferrom agnetic ordering tem perature.

C onceming the ruthenates, recently Snow et al. (2002) and Rho et al. (2003) have studied the evolution of the spin and lattice dynam ics through the pressure-tuned collapse of the antiferrom agnetic M ott-like phases of Ca2Ru0 4 , Ca3Ru20 7 , and Ca2 x Sr2Ru0 4 into a ferrom agnetic and possibly orbitally ordered m etallic state at low tem peratures. The studies have shown m any characteristic features resulting from the interplay of strong election-lattice and electron-election interactions. These include (i) evidence of an increase of the electron-phonon interaction strength, (ii) an increased tem perature dependence of the two-m agnon energy and linew idth in the antiferrom agnetic insulating phase, (iii) evidence of a charge gap developm ent signi cantly below the m etalinsulator transition (TMI), and (iv) a hysteresis associated with the structural phase change. The latter two e ests are indicative of a rst-orderm etal-insulator transition and a coexistence ofm etallic and insulating com ponents for T < TM I. The measurem ents have not yet been extended to probe the unconventional superconducting state at low tem peratures.

R am an m easurem ents on cubic and layered m anganites have been used to explore the interplay of spin, charge and orbital degrees of freedom . Y am am oto et al. (2000) and Rom ero et al. (2001) observe a suppression of the low-energy continuum at B 1g symm etry upon entering the charge and orbital-ordered state. The interpretation is not yet settled. P ossible candidates are spin density or dynam ical charge or it l uctuations (Y am am oto et al., 2000) or a collective C D W excitation R om ero et al. (2001). The controversy can probably not be solved without a quantitative theoretical description .

Bipmsson et al. (2000) have measured cubic La1 x SrxM n0 3 and via phonon lineshape analysis have shown strong electron-phonon interactions involving lo-

cal lattice distortions in the high tem perature param agnetic state which gradually vanish below the ferrom agnetic transition. A broad hum p in the electronic spectra develops at low tem peratures in the m etallic state around 400 cm - for x=02, and weakens in intensity and shifts to higher energies for x= 0.5. A lthough a polaronic peak w ould weaken w ith increasing carrier density, the shift tow ards higher energies with doping was interpreted rather as a low energy plasm a excitations within the ferrom agnetic metallic phase. Since recent ARPES studies on the sam e com pound (M annella et al., 2004) and bi-layer m anganite (M annella et al., 2005) have revealed coexistence of quasiparticle and polaron features in the metallic phase and do not show evidence for low energy plasm a excitations, m ore work is needed to clarify this issue.

A com prehensive study via re ectance and Ram an easurem ents on on P ro:7P b0:21C a0:09M nO 3, La0:64P b0:36M nO 37 La0:66P b0:23C a0:11M nO 37 and Pro:63Sr0:37M nO37 by Yoon et al. (1998), have shown that the electronic continuum displays a change from di usive polaronic peaks at high tem perature to a at featureless continuum, similar to that observed in the cuprates, in the low tem perature ferrom agnetic phase. A broad polaronic peak around 1200 cm - shifts to lower energies with increases doping indicative of weakened polaron binding energies. This is consistent with a crossover from a sm all-polaron-dom inated regim e at high temperatures to a large-polaron-dom inated low-tem perature regime. The low tem perature phase also provided evidence for the coexistence of large and small polarons, also in agreement with the ARPES results.

Recent work on Bix x CaxM nO 3 (x < 0:5) by Yoon et al. (2000) is of particular interest in connection with polarization studies for the evidence of charge ordering. A s shown in Figure 31, R am an scattering o ers a unique m eans of probing the unconventional spin and/or charge dynam ics that arise when charge carriers are placed in the complex spin environm ent of a charge ordered system s. U sing circularly (LL) in addition to linearly (xx and yy) polarized light anti-sym m etric com ponents of the Ram an tensor were isolated. In cubic crystals such as Big x C ax M nO 3 they transform as the T1g irreducible representation (equivalent to A2q in tetragonal materials like the cuprates). U pon entering the charge-ordered phase a quasielastic scattering response appears with the T1g symmetry of the spin-chirality operator. Thus it was conjectured that the chiral excitations were signatures of either a chiral spin-liquid state associated with the M n core spins, or of closed-loop charge m otion caused by the constraining environm ent of the complex orbital and Neel textures. A possible path for charge m otion is shown in Figure 31, em phasizing the circular nature of charge transfer. It is rem arkable, that the spectral shape and the tem perature variation of the characteristic energy are quite sim ilar to the low energy response in the cuprates (see section IV D .3) although a state w ith static order is entered in Bi4 x CaxM nO 3. It is interesting and
perhapsim portanthow the two typesofresponse are related.

T he story of the cuprates began w ith the discovery of superconductivity by Bednorz and M uller (1986) in La<sup>2</sup> <sup>x</sup> BaxC uO <sup>4</sup> w ith x ' 0:1:::0:2. Soon after the con rm ation by C ava et al.(1987),Y Ba2C u3O <sup>7</sup> w ith a T<sup>c</sup> above 90 K was synthesized (W u et al., 1987). T hese unexpected resultsled to furtherdiscoveriesofsuperconductivity in m aterials w ith a layered crystal structure w ith one or m ore C uO <sup>2</sup> planes per unit cell (Fig. 32). M aterialssynthesishasyielded com poundsw ith increasingly higherTc,and m ajor advances have been m ade in single-crystalgrow th m ethods,<sup>16</sup> providing a diversity of sam ples.

Yet we still do not have a theoretical fram ework to understand w hy.

U pon underdoping,the cuprates develop strong electronic anisotropies in the C uO <sup>2</sup> planes, w hich can be thought ofas a signature of correlations. For this reason, m om entum resolution is crucialfor understanding thephysicalproperties.A R PES hasbeen very im portant from the beginning,revealing,am ong m any otherthings, a strong k dependence ofboth the superconducting energy gap and the pseudogap in the norm alstate (C am puzano etal.,2002;D am ascellietal.,2003). A s a m ore subtleeect,thequasiparticleweightZ <sup>k</sup> and theincoherent part ofthe spectralfunction were observed to have a substantial variation w ith k and doping p, im plying the im portance ofcorrelation eectsand the existence of strongly m om entum -dependent interactions (D am ascelli et al.,2003). M ore recent studies ofscanning tunneling m icroscopy (ST M )haveindicated a presenceofnanoscale disorder(M cElroy etal.,2005)in addition to the strong anisotropies identied from A R PES studies (D am ascelli etal.,2003).Both toolshave com bined to give insightof the tendencies these com pounds have towardselectronic

### A . From a D oped M ott Insulator to a Ferm iLiquid

T he so-called parentcom pounds ofthe cuprate superconductors are antiferrom agnetic M ott insulators. A t halflling,charges are com pletely localized and excited states are separated by the C oulom b energy U prohibiting double occupancy in the H ubbard m odel.<sup>18</sup> T he ground state is a H eisenberg antiferrom agnet w hich develops 3D long-range order below a N eeltem perature of typically 300 K .T he excitations are spin waves w ith a very sm all (in-plane) anisotropy gap at q = 0 and a nearest-neighbor exchange coupling J. T he spin waves havebeen studied rightatthe beginning by R am an scattering,and J wasdeterm ined from the two-m agnon peak to be of order 100 m eV .<sup>19</sup> Very early the existence of chiralspin excitations, i.e. excitations w here the spins are rotated out of the easy (C uO <sup>2</sup>) plane, was dem onstrated (Sulew skiet al.,1991). T he resonance prole<sup>20</sup> hasbeen described in term softhetripleresonancetheory ofC hubukov and Frenkel(1995a,b). Very recently,one m agnon excitations at q = 0 were observed in the N eel state ofLa<sup>2</sup> <sup>x</sup> SrxC uO <sup>4</sup> (G ozaret al.,2004) and related to D zyaloshinskii-M oriya and X Y opticalm odes resulting from a spin gap by Silva N eto and Benfatto (2005). T he experim ents are the q = 0 and ~ ! 0 m anifestation ofcanted spins w hich give also rise to scattering in the two-spinip channelatlargeenergiesin A <sup>2</sup><sup>g</sup> sym m etry (Sulew skietal.,1991).H ere,a lotm ore inform ation, such asthe D zyaloshinskii-M oriya vector,the size ofthe anisotropy gap,and the spin-lattice interaction strength, could be derived (G ozaretal.,2005b).

Ifthe insulator is doped o halflling,antiferrom agnetic long range orderdisappearsquickly w ith hole doping butsurvivesup to higherelectron doping levels(Figure 32). Yet shortranged antiferrom agnetic correlations arenotquenched even athigh doing levels,asseen by the persistence ofthe two-m agnon peak in B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> R am an scattering experim ents on both the hole-doped (Blum berg etal.,1994;R eznik etal.,1993;R ubhausen etal.,1999; Sugaiet al., 2003) and the electron-doped side (O nose et al.,2004) ofthe phase diagram . T his is sum m arized in Figure 33 for a num ber ofcom pounds and show show the two-m agnon peak softensand broadensw ith doping, eventually m erging into the continuum at higher doping levels. Since the two-m agnon intensity is dom inated by a double spin 
ip ofnearest neighbors,it can be observed even for sm allm agnetic correlation lengths <sup>m</sup> of the order offew lattice constants (see Figure 17). T he two-m agnon peak persists at least up to optim al doping for hole-doped system s (Fig. 33). T he position of the m axim um and the peak intensity decrease by factors ofroughly 2 and 20,respectively,for 0 p 0:16. C onsistent w ith the R am an results, neutron scattering experim entsin La<sup>2</sup> <sup>x</sup> SrxC uO <sup>4</sup> revealed m agnetic excitations in the com plete superconducting range (W akim oto etal.,2004).

T he broadening ofthe two-m agnon responsew ith doping and tem perature has been studied theoretically on clustersforthe t J m odel(Prelovsek and Jaklic,1998) and by quantum M onte C arlo (Q M C )techniques(Sandviketal.,1998),respectively.K nolletal.(1990)analyzed their experim ents at elevated tem peratures in term s of spin-lattice coupling. W hile m any features of the data at 1/2 lling for undoped cuprates can be captured by studies ofH E L F Eq. (46), in generalthe evolution of the m agnon lineshape w ith doping and tem perature and its fullpolarization dependence is not very wellunderstood. In particular,it is an unsettled issue,how ,w hen a m ore m etallic state develops for higher doping levels, the m agnon line m erges into the relatively featureless continuum (show n in Figures 33 and 34) that extends well-beyond allrelevant energy scales such as ~qv<sup>F</sup> ,the superconducting energy gap or the m axim alphonon energy ~!<sup>D</sup> . In strongly overdoped yet superconducting sam ples (0:20 < p < 0:27),the physicalproperties in the norm alstate are stillnot those ofa conventional m etal.T hecontinuum itselfdisplayssignicantpolarization and doping dependence,w hich w illbe addressed in section IV .D .

For p > 0:05 (n > 0:12), superconductivity em erges and reachesa m axim alT<sup>c</sup> atapproxim atelyp = 0:16(n = 0:14).In the R am an spectra,superconductivity induced peaks em erge out of the 
at continuum in the norm al state,accom panied by spectralweightreorganization for tem peratures below Tc,as show n for Bi2Sr2C aC u2O 8+ in Figure 34.

## B . Superconducting Energy G ap and Sym m etry

Early R am an results for the electronic continuum showed only little dierence between the norm aland the superconducting states (Lyons et al., 1987). W e know now that the relatively high defect concentration in the rst sam ples suppressed the structures related to the gap. T he synthesis of 
ux-grow n Y Ba2C u3O <sup>7</sup> w ith a suciently sm allnum ber ofdefects (K aiseret al.,1987; Schneem eyeretal.,1987)im proved the situation rapidly, and a clearindication ofthe pair-breaking eectwasobtained by C ooperetal.(1988a)on Y Ba2C u3O <sup>7</sup>,show ing the em ergence ofa peak and reorganized spectralweight occurring for tem peratures below T<sup>c</sup> as expected from theory.Soon thereaftera strong polarization dependence ofthe R am an spectra wasobserved (Fig.34),w hich can be considered the rst spectroscopic evidence of a gap anisotropy (C ooper et al., 1988b; H ackl et al., 1988b; Slakey etal.,1990a;Yam anaka etal.,1988).In contrast to conventionalm aterials (see,e.g.,Fig.24),there is no sharp onsetofthe scattering intensity ata threshold.A s an explanation ofthe continuous increase ofthe scattering intensity atsm allfrequenciesthe possibility ofnodes wasdiscussed early (H ackletal.,1988b;M onien and Zawadow ski,1989).O riginally show n in Bi2Sr2C aC u2O 8+ and Y Ba2C u3O <sup>7</sup>, the studies were quickly extended to other optim ally hole doped cuprates. It was show n by K ang et al. (1996,1997) that m agnetic elds suppress the peaks,independently indicating theirrelationship to superconductivity.

T he polarization dependence of both the peak frequencies and the low -energy slopes ofthe superconducting spectra had been a vexing problem for severalyears follow ing the rst observation of the reorganized spectralweightand the polarization-dependentresponse.A s show n in Figure 34,the peak in the B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> response developed at roughly 30 percent higher energies than forB <sup>2</sup><sup>g</sup> or A1<sup>g</sup> polarization geom etries, and the low frequency spectra rose as <sup>3</sup> forB <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> and linearly w ith for other channels.In addition,the tem perature dependentdepletion at low frequency shifts was faster in B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> sym m etry than in other channels.

T he satisfactory description em erged as soon as the m om entum dependences ofthe R am an verticesofdierent sym m etries , (k), and of the energy gap (k) were properly taken into account,as outlined in Section II.D .6.A sindicated by a few experim entsbefore (H ardy etal.,1993;Shen etal.,1993)and corroborated by m any m ore later (Scalapino,1995),a gap w ith dx<sup>2</sup> <sup>y</sup> <sup>2</sup> sym m etry isthem ostcom patiblew ith theresultsin thecuprates (D evereaux etal.,1994a).

A n additional conrm ation of d wave pairing cam e from theim purity eectson theR am an spectra in thesuperconducting state (D evereaux,1995b;Lim onov et al., 2002b; M isochko et al., 1999). R am an scattering, like othertypesofresponses(A R PES,infrared and tunneling spectroscopy,N M R ,etc.) couplesonly to the m agnitude and notto the phase ofthe orderparam eterand,hence, cannot discrim inate between a dx<sup>2</sup> <sup>y</sup> <sup>2</sup> and jdx<sup>2</sup> <sup>y</sup> <sup>2</sup> jgap, i.e. the sign change ofthe d-wave gap is not accessible. Im puritieshowevercould distinguish between energy gap w hich were conventionalyet had accidentalnodes from a pure d wave energy gap (Borkow skiand H irschfeld, 1994). W hile peaks in the B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> channel are generally suppressed by im purities,the theory for R am an scattering in disordered d wave superconductors predicted a crossover from linear to cubic frequency dependence at a characteristic frequency ! set by the im purity concentration,w hile a true threshold would develop if the nodes were accidental (D evereaux, 1995b). Show n in Fig.35, along w ith the im provem ent of sam ple quality and instrum entation,the crossoverfrom a linearto a cubic frequency dependence was found to directly dem onstrate the in
uence ofim purities and to further solidify thed wavepictureforhole-doped cuprates,ascem ented by SQ U ID m easurem ents,reviewed in R efs. (T sueiand K irtley,2000;Van H arlingen,1995)<sup>22</sup>.

<sup>21</sup> D ue to this high ratio, w e note how ever that in certain cases (M artinho etal.,2004;Zeyher and G reco,2002) the B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> peak is thought not to be related directly to a 2 feature. H ow ever w e note that 2=k <sup>B</sup> T<sup>c</sup> 10 em erges from strong coupling d w ave treatm ents (M onthoux and Scalapino, 1994), and is consistent w ith the broadening ofthe B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> signalobserved near 2.

<sup>22</sup> W e em phasize again thatdisorderrapidly suppressesgap features in the R am an spectra (see section II.D .6). E ven in a d-w ave superconductor w here T<sup>c</sup> reacts sensitively to im purities the peaks disappear long before T<sup>c</sup> vanishes. H ence, the characterization of the sam ples is a central issue. D oping generally introduces defects along w ith spins or carrierssuch as N iin the C uO <sup>2</sup> plane orSrin La<sup>2</sup> <sup>x</sup> SrxC uO <sup>4</sup> and clustersofoxygen in Y B a2C u3O 6+ x (E rb etal.,1996b;Pekkeretal.,1991)suppressing the gap structures rapidly.

A dditional attributes have been intensely investigated, such as the agreem ent of the e ective m ass approxim ation calculated within LDA for d wave superconductors in Y B a2 u30 7 (Strohm and Cardona, 1997), e ects of orthorhom bicity and mixing of s wave components allowed by sym metry (Nem etschek et al, 1998; Strohm and Cardona, 1997), as well as the issue of the A 1g peak seen in the superconducting state (K rantz and C ardona, 1994), which is am ong the com plicated though eventually crucial problem son the way to a better understanding of the cuprates.

### 2. The A 1g problem { Zn, Niand Pressure

W hile the B1g and the B2g spectra are in reasonable agreem ent with the predictions on the basis of d-wave pairing various problem s arose in A 1g symm etry which slowed down the acceptance of the model in the beginning. One of the objections was the strong intensity found in the A 10 channel. A s discussed in Section IID 6, the A 1g response is com plicated due to the back ow term swhich are as singular as the bare term s for frequencies at the gap edge, leading to cancellations of diverging intensities. For both a cylindrical Ferm i surface and a tight-binding band structure (Devereaux et al., 1994b; K rantz and Cardona, 1994), the e ective m ass approxim ation predicts a suppression ofthe A1g intensity in com parison to other channels, in contrast to what is found experim entally, as shown in Figures 34 and 38. Since the e ective m ass approxim ation is of questionable utility in high ly correlated system s like the cuprates, this ob jection w as not as serious, as an overall com parison of spectral intensities is not possible without detailed know ledge of the Ram an scattering m atrix elem ents given in Eq. (36). G ood ts to the data of the A 1g ; B 2g and B 1g sym m etries (with the overall intensities as free param eters) could be obtained (D evereaux and E inzel, 1995a). H ow ever, a sensitivity to band structure and higher harm onics of the energy gap and Ram an vertices found in the calculations implied a sim ilar sensitivity to details of the m aterials which was not observed in the data.

Further, it was argued by K rantz and C ardona (1994) that scattering in a multi-band system - such as in the C u0 2 bilayer -would yield a sharp intensity at tw ice the gap edge, which was again inconsistent with the data on single-and double-layer system s available at that time.

The issue of multiband scattering was partially resolved by Devereaux et al. (1996). It was found that if the energy gaps were equal on at least tw o sheets of the Ferm i surface split by bi-layer hopping, a diverging intensity would be possible. How ever the intensity is only proportional to the di erence of the individual R am an vertices of the bands. This is a qualitative reason why the multi-band case would give peaks only under quite special conditions, in plying that the ts obtained from the single band case are still valid. Yet, it does not satisfactorily explain the sensitivity of the A 1g response to

band and energy gap an isotropy factors.

A recent undertaking to understand the origin of the A 1g intensity has involved the response of the peak to partial replacem ent (up to a few percent) of Cu by Zn and/or Ni in YBa2Cu30 7 (Gallais et al, 2002; Le Tacon et al, 2005; Lim onov et al, 2002b; M artinho et al, 2004). M artinho et al. (2004) found that the intensity of the A 10 peak was insensitive to either Ni or Zn doping, while the peak in B1g is suppressed by Zn, in agreem ent with earlier results (Lim onov et al, 2002b). A s show n in Figure 36, G allais et al. (2002) found that the peak position in A1q was reduced by N i im purities and made the im portant observation that it followed that of the m agnetic spin resonance m ode (Sidis et al, 2004). Le Tacon et al. (2005) found that Zn doping increased the low frequency spectral weight and suppressed the B1g peak without changing its position. It is not clear why the position of the B1g peak does not change while Tc decreases. Possible explanations are an inhom ogeneous distribution of the impurities or an accidental cancellation e ect between the decreasing 2 (T ¿) and an increase of the peak energy ~ peak because of defects (D evereaux, 1995b). The shift of the A 1g peak with Zn argued for a two-com ponent picture including a contribution from a collective m ode such as the resonance in the spin wave spectrum (H inkov et al., 2004).

Two approaches concerning the presence of a collective m ode in the spectra superim posed upon a well-screened background have been put forw ard recently by Venturini

**Caption:** Figure 10 compares low energy Raman response functions for Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+ at different doping levels represented in different fluctuation modes (B1g and B2g). The Raman shift axis identifies energy-dependent shifts, and the spectral line differences highlight how doping affects asymmetry in energy scales. The findings are crucial in examining how electronic interactions are influenced by doping, especially in alterations in the charge dynamics and coherence phenomena in cuprates.

<sup>23</sup> It is interesting to note that the resonance of the tw o-m agnon peak isclose to the charge transfergap of2.5 eV orhigher(B lum berg et al.,1997a;K nollet al.,1996;R ubhausen et al.,1997).

tions (Jandlet al, 1993) in Nd2 x CexCu0 4 were studied soon after the discovery (Tokura et al, 1989) and explained thoroughly. An exception was the A 1g line at 590 cm 2 , assigned by Heyen et al. (1991) as a localized m ode of interstitial oxygen in apex position (cf. F ig. 32). Later on, O nose et al. (1999) could indeed dem onstrate that the m ode is suppressed after annealing the sam ples in reducing atm osphere in order to induce or enhance Tc. The rst electronic Ram an spectra in the superconducting state of slightly overdoped N d1:84 C Q :16 C u0 4 show ed a sm all gap an isotropy (Stadlober et al, 1995). The ratio 4:1 2 =kB Tc 4:9 is sim ilar to that of strong coupling conventional superconductors like P b, N b or N b3 Sn (see Table II). The tem perature dependence of the gap is relatively close to the BCS prediction (Blumberg et al., 2002; Stadlober et al, 1995). This motivated an interpretation in term s of an anisotropic s-w ave gap, yielding a reasonable description of both the shape and the positions of the B 1g and B 2g pair-breaking peaks (Stadlober et al, 1995).

Sim ilar spectral shapes were also found at other doping levels for both Nd2 x CexCu0 4 and Pr2 x CexCu0 4, as show n in Figure 39. The low energy sides of the peaks were found to be alm ost doping independent and closer to those of hole-doped cuprates than to those in conventional superconductors when sam ples and instrum entation facilitated im proved measurem ents close to = 0.

Recent ARPES (A m itage et al, 2001; M atsui et al, 2005) and interferom etric experim ents (Chesca et al., 2003; T suei and K irtley, 2000) provided evidence of a d-type gap bringing antiferrom agnetic spin uctuations back into play as a possible coupling mechanism . Since the diam eter of the Ferm i surface encircling ( ; ) is sm aller here than in hole-doped system s, the antiferrom agnetic ordering vector Q AF = ( ; ) connects spots close to ( =2; =2) rather than in the vicinity of ( ; 0) for p doping and the qap is expected to have a m axim um at the hot spots and to decrease tow ards ( ; 0).

0 n this basis B lum berg et al. (2002) proposed a novel type ofnon-m onotonic d-wave gap w ith m axim a only approxim ately 15 away from the diagonal. An explicit calculation using the suggested (k) (B lum berg et al., 2002) in a one-band m odelapproxim ately reproduces the overall line shapes but reveals discrepancies in the peak positions (Venturiniet al, 2003) (see also B lum berg et al. (2003)). Better agreem ent between experim ent and theory can be obtained with a m onotonic d wave qap in a two band picture (Liu et al., 2005) for which evidence has been found by m agnetotransport (Foumier et al., 1997).

Four rem arks are to be considered: (i) In ARPES, the gap maximum is found approxim ately at the hot spot where a pseudogap is observed above To M atsui et al, 2005). (ii) No quasiparticle peaks indicating coherence in the superconducting state are resolved in ARPES (Arm itage et al., 2001; M atsui et al., 2005). (iii) Twice the gap energy observed by ARPES is - 40% smaller than that derived from the Ram an spectra (M atsuiet al, 2005). (iv) Phase-sensitive experim ents (A 1 et al, 1999)

and results on the m agnetic penetration depth (K okales et al, 2000; Skinta et al, 2002a) are supportive of an stype gap .

Hence in spite of m ounting evidence of d-wave pairing, explanations for the symmetry dependence of the Ram an spectra and several other experim ents are still m issing. A possible explanation could lie in a crossover from d to s pairing upon increasing doping (Skinta et al, 2002b). How ever, Ram an data from di erently doped P r2 x C ex C u 0 4 (see Figure 39) do not show a variation of the lineshape and su ciently strong sym m etry dependence of the pair-breaking features in the proper doping range (Q azibash et al., 2005).

In the hole doped system s, on the other hand, strong variations ofthe lineshapes at A 10 and B 10 sym m etry are found although there is little doubt about the persistence of the (dom inant) d-wave nature of the superconducting gap in the entire phase diagram (T suei and K irtley, 2000). The doping and polarization dependence of the R am an spectra in superconducting p-type cuprates w ill be the subject of the next section .

#### C . Superconducting Gap : D oping D ependence

O ne of the early Ram an experim ents on doping e ects in overdoped B i2 Sr2C aC u20 a+ show ed the energy of the pair-breaking peak in B1g symm etry to decrease much faster than those at the other sym m etries and T 。(Staufer et al., 1992). The rst system atic study w as perform ed by K endziora and Rosenberg (1995) on B & Sr2CaC u2O 8+ shown in the inset of Figure 37. The doping level in this m aterial can be varied continuously and reliably between 0:15 p p 0:23 by changing the oxygen concentration (K endziora et al, 1993; Triscone et al., 1991). At low er oxygen doping, the structure is possibly metastable or unstable, at higher doping the oxygen di uses out even at room temperature. Underdoping is better achieved by replacing Cawith Y . As an essential result, the pairbreaking peaks at A 1q , B 1g , and B 2g , sym m etry are found to depend in di erent ways on doping and, consequently, on Tc. This doping dependence is shown in Figure 40 for recent m easurem ents on B i2 Sr2C a1 x Y x C u20 g+ by Sugai et al. (2003). Most remarkably, the B1g pairbreaking peak is proportional to (1 p) rather than To in the doping range indicated, but fades in intensity for underdoped m aterials. The peak energies in B2g sym m etry how ever scale m ore or less with the transition tem perature. For p < 0:15 the B 1g peak becom es very weak, yet a clear 2 peak survives in the B 2g channel for all doping levels.

In the decade to follow there were num erous studies on di erently doped cuprates, including B B 252CaC u20 8+ 24 2 8+ 24 B 2 C u30 6+ x 25

at p ' 0:16 the peaks in the three Ram an active symmetries are in relative positions expected for d wave pairing, the ratio 2 m ax=kB To is approxi m ately 8,32

in the overdoped range, p > 0:16, the Bg peak frequency decreases faster than To obeying B 19 = Tm ax

**Caption:** Figure 15 illustrates the relationship between normalized peak frequency (Ω_peak/Tc^max) and doping level (p) in superconductors. The trend observed shows how peak frequency varies with increasing doping, representing a parabola-like trend. This figure is significant for elucidating the doping dependence of peak modes in the superconducting state, directly impacting our understanding of the electronic properties and phase stability within these materials.

The gap close to the node, which is projected out in B 2g symmetry, is also found by penetration depth, low bias STM , and the Nemst e ect to m ore or less follow the transition tem perature for all doping levels (D eutscher, 1999, 2005; Panagopoulos and Xiang, 1998; Xu et al, 2000). However it is inconsistent with peak-to-peak m easurem ents of tunneling density of states (Zasadzinski et al, 2002), the energy of the ( ;0) peak in the spectral finction (C am puzano et al., 2002), and them al conductivity (Sutherland et al, 2005), which when interpreted in term sofd wave quasiparticle picture (Durst and Lee, 2000) indicate that the gap energy continues to increase with decreased doping. This highlights one of the major issues in the cuprates of whether the superconducting pairing energy rises with underdoping or follow s T c and this certainly requires further study.

In m any experim ents, a second energy scale is observed which varies approxim ately as po p, sim ilar to peak . The maprity of authors (T im usk and Statt, 1999) call it a pseudogap T (see Fig. 32) with a / T . The understanding of the pseudogap is a m atter of intense research at present. A possible relation to the B 1g R am an data w illbe discussed below in section IV .C .

In the underdoped range, the interpretation is more controversial. The main issues are whether or not the B 2g pair-breaking peak can be observed at all doping levels and how the B1g spectra evolve for p < 0:16.

The B 2g problem seem sto converge with the im provem ent of the sam ple quality. The cleaner the sam ples, the clearer the B 2q pair-breaking peak, as expected theoretically (Devereaux, 1995b). The problem can be visualized in Y B a2C u30 6+ x where oxygen tends to cluster and to form pinning centers if the Cu-O chains are not com pletely lled (Erb et al., 1996b). How ever, in addition to fully oxygenated Y B a2 C u30 7 , partially ordered phases exist for x = 0:5 with T . ' 60 K and x = 0:353 w ith To ! 0 (Liang et al, 2000, 2002) where every second and third chain is lled, respectively. Therefore, the maxim a are pronounced in Y B a2C u30 6:50 and Y B a2C u30 6:98 (0 pelet al., 2000), while the peak is sm eared out at optim al doping, Y B a2C u30 6:93, and practically disappears slightly below (Sugaiet al, 2003). The problem of oxygen clustering exists also in B 222C aC u20 8+ , but the

resulting potentials are weaker and essentially doping independent, as can be seen directly from the com parison of di erent overdoped sam ples (0 pelet al, 2000; Venturini et al, 2002c) exhibiting nearly constant intensity of the B 2g pair-breaking features. In a sim ilar fashion, partial replacem ent ofC a by Y does not create a strong im purity potentialeither. This was directly shown by electron spin resonance (ESR ) (Janossy et al., 2003) in Y B a2C u30 6:1 r where Ca in place of Y is a very weak im purity which does not localize carriers even at low tem perature and doping. We conclude that Y and O doping can be used m ore or less sim ultaneously in B in B in B in B & Sr2C aC u20 g + as long as Y is distributed statistically. The direct com parison of the data presented in Fig. 40 w ith those of 0 pel et al. (2000) and Venturini et al. (2002c) indeed show s that the B 2g pair-breaking peaks have doping and dopant. (0 , Y ) independent intensities if a high sample quality can be m aintained. Under these conditions, the B 2g m axim a seem to exist at all doping levels and apparently scale with Tc. Since in Y Ba2C u30 6+ x and La2 x Srx Cu0 4 doping changes both carrier concentration p and m ean free path `, the pair breaking peaks appear and disappear depending on the doping dependent order.

It is im portant to rem ember these considerations for the analysis of the B1g data. This is particularly im portant when intensity issues are discussed. Therefore, we focus rst on Y-under- and 0 -overdoped B 2Sr2CaCu2O 8+ (Fig. 40) to determ ine the intensity evolution of the B 1g pair-breaking structure. It becom es very weak right below optim aldoping while no signi cant weakening of the B 2g structures is observed. The gradual suppression of the B1g coherence peaks in Ram an goes along with the disappearance of the 2 peaks in scanning tunneling m icroscopy (M cE lroy et al., 2003). This is corroborated by results in partially ordered Y B a2 C u30 6:5, in La1:9Sr0:10CuO4,HgBa2Cu0 4, and HgBa2Ca2Cu308, where the B 2g structures are well resolved, while in B 1g symmetry, no pair-breaking e ect could be found (G allais et al, 2005; Naeini et al, 1999; O pel et al, 2000; Venturiniet al, 2002b).

W hen the peak is observed in B 1g in the underdoped region, as show n in F igure 41, its position does not track T c and lies within the scatter of points or slightly below the values of 2 generally obtained via ARPES (C am puzano et al., 2002) and peak-to-peak positions in tunneling measurem ents (Zasadzinskiet al, 2002) 37 It has been arqued by Chubukov et al. (1999, 2006) and Zeyher and G reco (2002) that the B 1g peak in R am an m easure m ents in underdoped com pounds m ay be due to a collective m ode appearing below T c from either spin-coupling

<sup>37</sup> W e point out how ever that there is considerable uncertainty in determ ining the gap from ARPES, as both the leading edge and the peak of the spectrum have been used. In either case, the antinodal spectral function is very broad in underdoped system s and identifying an energy scale from a broad feature is not without uncertainty.

or d C D W order,respectively,split o from tw ice the gap m axim um 2. Yet this interpretation is inconsistent w ith the doping behavior ofthe pairing gap determ ined from B <sup>2</sup><sup>g</sup> sym m etry,as discussed above. In addition,thendingsofthedoping behavioroftheanti-nodal quasiparticles in the norm alstate (listed below in Section IV .C ) indicate that anti-nodal quasiparticles have becom eincoherentalready aboveoptim aldoping.T herefore itisnotintuitively obvioushow a propagating m ode could em erge deep in a region ofincoherence. A n alternative scenario isthatthe peak observed in B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> channels isstrongly altered by incoherenceand isa m easureofthe binding energy oflocalized anti-nodalelectrons,such as via the form ation ofresonance-valence bond singlets or sm allpolarons. Yet w hy a peak should appear rem ains to be understood. In any case,this issue highlights another vexing problem in the cuprates: how involved are the anti-nodalelectrons in superconductivity for underdoped system s.

T here were reports about B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> pair-breaking peaks at low doping p 0:1 (Blum berg etal.,1997a;Slakey etal., 1990b)appearing already aboveTc,ata doping independent position of approxim ately 600 cm <sup>1</sup> . In the discussion ofthe existence ofpreform ed pairs in the pseudogap state above T<sup>c</sup> and ofcollective m odes inside the gap (see Section II.D .7) that are indicative ofthe pairing potential,thisresulthasobviously som e im portance. H owever,in thevastm ajority oftheexperim ents,theobservation could not be conrm ed. Further com plication com esfrom the existence ofan oxygen im purity m ode in close vicinity (H ew itt et al., 1999;Q uilty et al., 1998). Future studies have to clarify this issue.

In conclusion, R am an scattering experim ents reveal two energy scales in the superconducting state w hich have a dierent dependence on doping: w hile the peaks in B <sup>2</sup><sup>g</sup> sym m etry follow the transition tem perature,the m axim um energy ofthose in B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> sym m etry decreasesas (p<sup>0</sup> p). In the m ajority of the experim ents, the coherence peaks in B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> sym m etry are found to fade away rapidly forp < 0:16.T he origin ofthe features observed atsm alldoping rem ains controversial.

The intensity changes of the Big spectra as a function of doping (Fig. 42) are accom panied by a qualitative change of the tem perature dependence at a given doping level. For B 2 Sr2CaC u20 8+ , the e ect is shown in the range 0:15 p 0:23 (Fig. 43). For Ba symmetry, there is little change of both the overall intensity and the initial slope which depends on tem perature as expected for a m etal. A s opposed to B 2g sym metry, the tem perature dependence of the B 1g spectra reverses sign (F ig . 43 (a)), indicating non-m etallic behavior at p = 0:15. A s outlined above (Eq. (55)), the initial slope ofthe response function is proportionalto a transport lifetim e or, equivalently, a conductivity. A ccordingly, the inverse of it, [0 0=@ ] 1 is a resistivity which, for the Ram an selection rules, is m om entum sensitive as indicated by the index

It has been shown by O pelet al. (2000) that both the energy dependences and the magnitudes of ( ;T ) = ~= ( ;T ) and m ( ;T )=m b = 1 + ( ;T ) can be determ ined from the spectra using a m em ory function anal ysis (Gotze and W ol e, 1972) in combination with an energy integral over (\sum rule"). By extrapolating the results to = 0, very reliable num bers for ( ! 0;T ) can be obtained. 40

In Fig. 44, the \R am an resistivities" ( lim it = 0 are plotted for = B 1g ;B 2g at various tem peratures and doping levels. The B 2g results com pare well to conventional resistivities (T) using the Drude expression ( ( = 0;T ) = " o (+p1)2 (T ) w ith the renorm alized plasma frequency \*p1. W ith the plasma frequency in eV and the resistivity in - om , one nds (T) ' 1:08 (Ep1)2 (T). At p = 0:23, the transport is essentially isotropic. Below p = 0:22, anisotropy develops quite abruptly, and for p < 0:16, the tem perature dependence of the Big ( = 0;T ) becom es nonm etallic. This crossover behavior has been interpreted in

term s of an unconventionalm etal-insulator transition at 0:20 < p < 0:22, where the antinodal transport is gradually quenched while the nodal one rem ains essentially una ected (Venturiniet al, 2002a).

Since the current vertex has a sim ilar k dependence as the B2q Ram an vertex, IR spectroscopy and, sim ilarly, dc transport project out mainly the nodal part of the Ferm i surface (Devereaux, 2003b), and show therefore good qualitative agreem ent with the B 2g R am an results, which exhibit little variation with doping for 0:1 < p < 0:23 beyond the change of top1, as shown in Figure 44. The suppression of the antinodal transport goes along with a reduction of the quasiparticle strength Zx in the vicinity of ( ; 0) (Kim et al, 2003), and a collapse of the K orringa law (T1T) 1 = const as observed by NMR , where T1 is the spin-lattice relaxation time (A lloulet al, 1989; B illinge et al., 2003) .

Below p ' 0:16, insulating behavior can also be observed in conventional transport at low temperature if superconductivity is suppressed with high m agnetic elds (Ando et al., 2004a; Boebinger et al., 1996). The logarithm ic divergence of the resistivity in the limit T ! 0 indicates localization of the carriers. The crossover from m etallic to non-m etallic behavior occurs at tem peratures T < Te, well below those found in B 1g R am an scattering. This is consistent with the observation that the B 2g spectra do not show any anom aly in the norm al state. The synopsis of NM R, conventional, and R am an transport leads to the quite consistent conclusion that carriers get gradually localized upon decreasing doping. A ccording to the Ram an results, the suppression of free-carrier transport starts at p ' 0:21 at the antimodal regions of the Ferm isurface and gradually m oves tow ards the nodal points with decreasing p. The conductivity apparently disappears only very close to or at zero doping, m aking connection to recent ARPES results which show quasiparticles along the nodal direction even at the low est (yet nite) doping level (Y oshida et al., 2003) .

anen and Gunnarsson, 1989), charge ordering such as stripes or density waves (Andergassen et al., 2001; C astellaniet al, 1995; Chakravarty et al, 2001; K ivelson et al, 2003) and Ferm i surface deform ation uctuations M etzner et al, 2003). In all cases, static order is found only, if at all, at very low doping and/or in speci cally m odied structures such as La2 y x Rey Srx Cu0 4 for y ' 0:4 and Re = Nd;Eu K lauss et al, 2000; Tranquada et al, 1995) or the nickelates. In La1:775SL0:225N 10 4 Pashkevich et al, 2000) and La1:67Sro:33N iO4 (Blum berg et al, 1998; Y am am oto et al, 1998) the form ation of static distortions due to the form ation of stripes are big enough to split phonon and magnon lines due to zone doubling and to suppress the B 1g continuum at low energies.

O f course, static order is much easier to verify than uctuating order. Nevertheless, uctuating incommensurate spin order has been observed in La2 x Sr2Cu0 4 for x 0:055 (Fujita et al., 2002), Y B @ C u30 6:85, and Y B a2C u30 6;6 (Hinkov et al, 2004), while commensurate spin order is seen at low energies in Y B a2C u30 6:353 (Stock et al., 2006). This means that in a tem perature dependent volum e characterized by a coherence length s (T ) a superstructure of the antiferrom agnetically ordered spins is established for higher doping levels. At the sam e time the charges which are expelled from the antiferrom agnetic regions becom ing spatially organized as well. This type of order has sim ilarity with a liquid crystal and is som etim es referred to as nem atic (K ivelson et al, 1998, 2003). From these experim ents it cannot be decided whether the uctuating magnetic superstructure is a property of the spins or of the charges. For statically ordered La2 y x N dy Srx Cu0 4 w ith doping x = 1=8, Tranquada et al. (1995) showed that charge ordering precedes spin ordering when the tem perature is reduced. It has indeed been shown that charge ordering uctuations are quite comm on phenom ena in correlated system s (Castellaniet al, 1995; M etzner et al, 2003).

A s long as there is no long range or static order which com petes with superconductivity, the uctuations can establish Cooper pairing (Chakravarty et al., 2001; Perali et al, 1996). For this reason, the understanding of the dynam ics of incipient charge and spin order is a very interesting subject in the cuprates.

# 3. Role of Fluctuations and Incipient Ordering Phenom ena at sn all doping

The study of dynam ical order requires inelastic probes typically sensitive at nite q. In the case of charge ordering, resonant X -ray scattering is the m ost prom ising as it can provide direct evidence for the charge ordering at a particular wavevector (Abbam onte et al., 2004), w hile neutrons can be used only if the charges m odulate the lattice or the spin structure. W hile optical methods are con ned to q = 0 two excitations with opposite momenta can be created, such as multiphonon or two m agnon scattering. Therefore light can be scattered

In the copper-oxygen system s, an unexpected additional component in the B 1g spectra was observed in La1:90Sr0:10Cu0 4: as shown in Figure 46, a peak is found in the 100 cm 2 range which gains intensity and m oves to very low but nite energy with decreasing tem perature (Tassiniet al, 2005; Venturiniet al, 2002b).42 At high energy for all tem peratures, and at high tem perature for all energies, the spectra of the cuprates with p ' 0:10 in general are similar and show a strong anisotropy between nodal and anti-nodal regions in the Brillouin zone (see Fig. 42, 43, and 44). At low tem perature the low energy feature is unique to La1:90Sr0:10CuO 4, while the spectra become atter in Y B a2 C u30 6:5 and B 2522 (Y 0:38 C a0:62 )C u2 0 8+ (see Fig. 43). To appreci ate the di erences, one has to recallthat the conventional transport properties of all these com pounds are very sim ilar (Ando et al, 2004). Before we discuss possible inter-

The interpretation of response lines correlates with orientation and order of stripes in the lattice, providing insights into fluctuation phenomena important for understanding superconductivity at small dopings.

pretationswew ish to com pare results for di erent doping levels and m aterials.

From the com parison of the low energy peak to infrared results, a relationship to uctuating stripe order was conjectured (Venturini et al., 2002b). For further support, it seem s w orthw hile to exploit the selection rules Ram an scattering o ers. The e ect in B 1g sym metry is indeed com patible with the orientation of stripes along the Cu{O bonds at p = x = 0:10 (Fujita et aL, 2002). This is simply because order along the principal axes of an essentially tetragonal lattice corresponds to an orthorhom bic distortion. Fluctuations correspond to m icro-tw inning, m eaning that x and y cannot be accessed individually. Hence, B 1g symmetry measuring only the di erence xx exactly this distortion. As a fam iliar example, we recall that fully oxygenated Y B a2C u30 7 has C u {0 chains along the crystallographic b axis m aking b > a. Even if the sam ple is tw inned, the chain contributions are alw ays superim posed on the B1g spectra, while the xx and yy spectra are equal (as opposed to a single dom ain crystal) . For x < 0:055, a reorientation by 45 is observed by neutron scattering (Fujita et al, 2002). Since B 1g and B 2q are equivalent m odulo a =4 rotation in the basalplane of a tetragonal lattice, the related peak should now appear in B2g rather than in B1g symmetry. In fact, this has be observed in La1:98SD:02Cu0 4, as show n in Figure 46 (Tassiniet al, 2005).

**Caption:** Illustrating the behavior of various dopants in LMNO compounds, this figure connects changes in lattice parameters with modifications in electronic properties due to cation substitution. The graph compares effects like spin state transitions and crystal field influences evidenced by distinct shifts resulting from different elemental substitutions in the crystal structure.

Spectra sim ilar to those in La1:98Sr0:02C uO 4 (Fig. 46) are found in (Y 0:97C a0:03)B a2C u30 6:1 w ith p ' 0:02 (Fig. 47 (b)). Owing to the hom ogeneity of the sam ple, the peak is very narrow and well de ned. A s the low energy peak em erges, the intensity of the continuum is suppressed by roughly 30 % over an energy range of approxim ately 550 cm ² in a sim ilar though much stronger w ay than at higher doping (Nem etschek et al., 1997;O pel et al., 2000). In B 1g symmetry, there is an overall loss of spectral weight up to much higher energies, sim ilar to Y Ba2C u30 6+ x and B 2522C aC u20 8+ at higher dopings, dem onstrating the transition to a correlated insulator (Freericks and Devereaux, 2001).

Simultaneously with the studies in La1:90Sx0:10Cu04, the quasi 1D ladder compound Sri4 x CaxCu240 41 was investigated (Blumberg et al, 2002; Gozar et al, 2003) which is considered a model system for the high-T c cuprates (D agotto and R ice, 1996; D agotto, 1999; Sigrist et al, 1994). At tem peratures above approxim ately 450 K low energy spectral peaks similar to those in

La1:90Sr0:10Cu0 4 are found (Fig. 48), athough their energies and widths are an order ofm agnitude sm aller. The w idth obeys an A rihenius law with a doping independent activation energy of approxim ately 2100 K . In the insulator (x = 0), the conductivity (forT < 300 K ) reveals a sim ilar while for x = 12 the conductivity is m etallic above 70 K (Gozar et al, 2003; Gozar and B lum berg, 2005a). The position of the m axim um and the width decrease upon cooling. In both cases, for T < 450 K the peaks move below the detection limit of 2 cm 1 . Below 250 K , no indication of the peaks can be detected any more. It is interesting to note that at least in undoped Sr14C u240 41 a charge ordered state develops below Tc o 250 K (Abbam onte et al, 2004).

In the ordered state Sr14C U240 41 has an optical response which is well described by that of a pinned charge density wave (B lum berg et al., 2002; Littlewood, 1987). For T > 250 K , the results are interpreted in term s of a dam ped plasm a oscillation above Tc o (Blum berg et al, 2002; Gozar et al, 2003; Gozar and Blum berg, 2005a). Since free carriers damp the m ode, the w idth is expected to increase proportional the conductivity just opposite to what one would expect from free carrier response. This com plicates the interpretation of the results in metallic Sr2Ca12C u240 41 where the width still increases with tem perature while the conductivity decreases. Gozar et al. (2003) argue that di erent regions of the Ferm i surface contribute to the transport and the damping in essentially 2D Sr2Ca12Cu24041.

A com parison of panels (a) and (b) of F igure 48 show s that the continuum surviving at low tem perature is signi cantly stronger in the metal (Fig. 48 (b)). W e there fore think that the low energy mode found at T > 250 K could also originate from incipient charge order. In Sri4 x CaxCu240 41 the mode is then superim possed on a free electron response in a sim ilar way as in the high-T cuprates.

It is interesting that sim ilar types of spectra are also found in Big x CaxM nO 3 (see section IIIE), exhibiting com parable tem perature dependences. W hile the results in ladders are interpreted in term s of an overdam ped plasm a m ode in a CDW system above the ordering tem perature (B lum berget al., 2002;G ozaret al., 2003;G ozar and B lum berg, 2005a), the response in the cuprates was proposed to originate from uctuations of the charge density in the vicinity of a charge-ordering instability (C aprara et al., 2005). Since the charge m odulation observed e.q. by tunneling microscopy (Ho man et al., 2002; Howald et al, 2003; Vershinin et al, 2004) is at nite q, two uctuations have to be exchanged to firl ll the q = 0 selection rule in Ram an scattering (C aprara et al, 2005; Venturini et al, 2000). Caprara et al. (2005) have shown that charge ordering uctuations at incom m ensurate wavevectors determ ined via neutron scattering (Fujita et al, 2002) yield proper lineshapes and selection rules in La1:90 SD:10 Cu0 4 and La1:98 Sr0:02 Cu0 4 . To which extent the spin channel is involved and whether sim ilar considerations apply to other dopings and cuprate

fam ilies have not been explored yet and rem ain im portant future topics.

In contrast to Sr14 x CaxC u240 41 , the low energy peak is strongly doping dependent in La2 x Sr2Cu04. The tem perature scale is di erent by a factor of 2 for the two doping levels studied (Fig. 46), im plying that T (0:02) 2T (0:10). The doping levelpc determ ined from extrapolating T to zero, T (pc) = 0, yields 0:15 pg 0:20 in close vicinity of the QCP inferred from other experim ents. It is therefore possible that the low energy response is related to the therm al and quantum uctuations above a hidden critical point.

In summary, the comparison of the cuprates studied suggests that there is a superposition of two anom alies in B1g symmetry: (i) below p ' 0:22 antinodal quasiparticles becom e localized in all com pounds as can be observed at su ciently high temperature; (ii) with decreasing tem perature a well-de ned peak develops in La1:90Sr0:10CuO4 at low energy. A lthough nothing com parable can be resolved in Y -and B i-based com pounds at the sam e doping level, the additional response m ay not necessarily be absent. It rather can m ean that the low energy features are broader and shifted to higher energies, hence becom ing very sim ilar in shape to the response from the 2D planes. Since the relationship between superconductivity and spin and/or charge uctuations is a key issue in the cuprates further work seem s worthw hile here.

#### V . CONCLUSIONS AND OPEN QUESTIONS

The results discussed in the course of this review dem onstrate that Ram an spectroscopy is and has been an invaluable tool to investigate the dynam ics of strongly correlated electrons. In provements in the experim ental technique have opened up the eld to a variety of new system s. Light scattering has o ered unique insights into dynam ics in di erent regions of the B rillouin zone, show ing the developm ent of ordering and the com petition be tween various phases as the role of correlations increases. M aterials such as superconductors with charge density wave order, correlated insulators, nuthenates, m anganites, and nally the superconducting cuprates show the rich variety of phenom ena which have been unveiled via Ram an investigations. A long the way, light scattering has considerably deepened our know ledge of dynam ics and correlation e ects, and has provided several key ingredients tow ards the developm ent of a com prehensive theoretical description of these m aterials.

Summarizing the ndings on correlated system s over the past several years, the key ingredients stem m ing from Ram an investigations include: (i) The developm ent of anisotropies as correlations are increased. Symmetryselective measurem ents provide a tool to zoom in on the dynam ics in di erent regions of the Brillouin zone. This is evidenced by Ram an scattering studies on M gB2 as well as the cuprates in the norm al and superconducting

phases, and the ordered phases in the ruthenates and the m anganites. (ii) T he existence ofcollective m odes. U sing R am an techniques the prevalence ofcertain types oforder as a consequence were identied. Evidence for the im portance of collective m odes com es from C D W superconductorsand m agnon scattering in antiferrom agneticinsulators,and im plicationsfora num berofpossible

uctuation or ordering m odes exist in the cuprates. (iii) A qualitative understanding ofquantum criticalbehavior. T he sym m etry projection of parts ofthe Brillouin zone com pletes the picture ofthe battleground between com peting ordersconcom itantw ith an underlying quantum phasetransition.H ere,spectralweighttransfersasa function oftem perature,doping,and pressure on a num ber of m aterials com bined w ith polarization dependent studies have opened a new door in the area ofquantum criticality.

It is clear that a num ber ofissues are stillofprim ary interest in correlated system s in general. T hese include (i)the origin ofthe electronic continuum in a num berof com pounds w hich look surprisingly sim ilar at rst pass. (ii) T he origin ofthe polarization dependence in m aterials w hich exhibit instabilities towards ordered phases. (iii)T hem apping ofBrillouin zone-projected electron dynam ics close to a quantum criticalpoint.

T he cuprates continue to provide a wealth of inform ation and puzzles in the area ofsuperconductivity and strong electronic correlations. Issues in w hich consensus has been reached include (i) the presence antiferrom agnetic correlationsover a w ide range ofdoping levels evidenced from the two-m agnon peak,(ii)the broad continuum in the norm alstate as a com m on feature ofall the cuprates, (iii) the d wave nature of the pair state below T<sup>c</sup> in a num ber of hole-doped m aterials derived from the low frequency power law s and polarization dependences,(iv) the dichotom y between the dynam ics of B <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> and B <sup>2</sup><sup>g</sup> quasiparticlesatlow dopings,w herethelow frequency anti-nodalB <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> behavior is governed by incoherence at the sam e tim e as the nodalB <sup>2</sup><sup>g</sup> quasiparticles show relatively doping-independent m etallic character,sim ilar to the ndings of transport quantities, and (v) the disappearance ofthis dichotom y for appreciably doped sam ples.

In the cuprates there are stillseveralunsettled questions.(i)W hatisthe origin oftheA1<sup>g</sup> and/orB <sup>1</sup><sup>g</sup> peaks in the superconducting state? D o they originate from the redistribution of superconducting quasiparticles or are they collective m odes or oflattice origin? (ii) H ow does the nodal/anti-nodal dichotom y picture of coherence/incoherence m erge into m etallic description athigh doping, BC S superconductivity for tem peratures below Tc,and antiferrom agnetism near halflling? (iii) W hat isthe m icroscopicorigin forlow energy peaksatlow doping,and how from this can inform ation be obtained on the com petition between ordered phases?

T hese are issuesw hich we believe w illform the plan of developm entofR am an scattering in the cupratesaswell as other m aterials in the years to com e. T he continuation ofinvestigationson m any new and well-characterized sam plesw illfurtherourknow ledge ofm aterialsand correlations, and applications of the use of pressure and m agnetic eld w illallow an exploration ofquantum criticality and evolution ofanisotropic electron dynam ics in a variety ofsystem s.
