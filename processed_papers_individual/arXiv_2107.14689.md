Compounds with the A15 structure have attracted extensive attention due to their superconductivity and nontrivial topological band structure. We have successfully grown Nb3Sb single crystals with a A15 structure and systematically measured the longitudinal resistivity, Hall resistivity and quantum oscillations in magnetization. Similar to other topological trivial/nontrivial semimetals, Nb3Sb exhibits large magnetoresistance (MR) at low temperatures (717%, 2 K and 9 T), unsaturating quadratic field dependence of MR and up-turn behavior in ρxx(T) curves under magnetic field, which is considered to result from a perfect hole-electron compensation, as evidenced by the Hall resistivity measurements. The nonzero Berry phase obtained from the de-Hass van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations demonstrates that Nb3Sb is topologically nontrivial. These results indicate that Nb3Sb superconductor is also a semimetal with large MR and nontrivial Berry phase, indicating that Nb3Sb may be another platform to search for Majorana zero-energy mode.

#### I. INTRODUCTION

The recent discovery of extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR) up to 106% in nonmagnetic semimetals has inspired tremendous interest in understanding its underlying physical mechanisms and exploring its applications in electronics [\[1,](#page-3-1) [2\]](#page-4-0). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the XMR found in the topologically nontrivial or trivial nonmagnetic semimetals. One scenario attributes the observed linear field dependent MR such as in Cd3As<sup>2</sup> [\[3,](#page-4-1) [4\]](#page-4-2) and Na3Bi [\[5,](#page-4-3) [6\]](#page-4-4) to nontrivial topology including the linear band dispersion. The classical carrier compensation mechanism was used to explain the non-saturating quadratic dependence of MR such as in WTe<sup>2</sup> [\[1\]](#page-3-1), lanthanum monopnictides LaPn (Pn = As, Sb, Bi) [\[7](#page-4-5)[–10\]](#page-4-6), as well as in VAs<sup>2</sup> [\[11\]](#page-4-7). An other mechanism argues that open-orbit trajectories of charge carriers driven by Lorentz force under magnetic field as a result of non-closed Fermi surface to be responsible for XMR as discussed by Zhang et al. [\[12\]](#page-4-8) and materials such as SiP<sup>2</sup> [\[13\]](#page-4-9) and MoO<sup>2</sup> [\[14\]](#page-4-10) appear to support this picture.

Recently, studies on bulk superconductivity in the materials with topologically nontrivial band structure have drawn a great deal of attention due to the possible realization of the Majorana zero-energy mode (MZM). Many compounds with the A15 structure [\[15\]](#page-4-11) exhibit high temperature superconductivity, such as Nb3Al (T<sup>c</sup> = 18.7 K), V3Si (T<sup>c</sup> = 16.8 K), Nb3Ge (T<sup>c</sup> = 21.8 K). It has also been suggested that the structure symmetry of A15 compounds with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) give rise to a gapped crossing near the Fermi level. For example, recent theoretical calculations revealed that A15 superconductors Ta3Sb, Ta3Sn, and Ta3Pb have nontrivial band topology in the bulk band structures and topological surface states arise near the Fermi level [\[16,](#page-4-12) [17\]](#page-4-13). In particular, Ta3Sb hosts an eightfold degenerate Dirac point close to the Fermi level at the high symmetry point [\[16\]](#page-4-12). First-principles calculations have shown that the gapped Dirac crossings in A15 compounds may result in giant spin Berry curvature and correspondingly giant intrinsic spin Hall effect [\[17\]](#page-4-13). Nb3Sb with the A15 strucuture is also a superconductor but with very low T<sup>c</sup> = 0.2 K [\[18\]](#page-4-14). Early research had observed de-Hass van Alphen (dHvA) quantum oscillations and Shubnikov-de Hass (SdH) oscillations under 21 T on Nb3Sb single crystals [\[19,](#page-4-15) [20\]](#page-4-16). Recent theoretical calculations indicate that Nb3Sb may have nontrivial topology in electronic structures. Gao et al. [\[21\]](#page-4-17) predicted various topological semimetals including Nb3Sb which is considered to host eightfold degenerate fermions. Zhang et al. [\[22\]](#page-4-18) suggested that Nb3Sb is a high symmetry point semimetal without SOC taken into consideration, while a topological insulator with SOC. Therefore, we attempt to grow Nb3Sb single crystals to study its topological nature.

In this work, based on the successful synthesis of Nb3Sb single crystals, we performed comprehensive measurements of longitudinal resistivity, Hall resistivity and the quantum oscillations of magnetization. Our results show that Nb3Sb has large unsaturated quadratic field dependent MR (717%, 2 K and 9 T) at low temperatures with up-turn behavior similar to other topological nontrivial/trivial semimetals. The Hall resistivity data indicates that Nb3Sb is a perfect hole-electron compensated semimetal. The nonzero Berry phase obtained from the dHvA quantum oscillation of magnetization demonstrates that Nb3Sb is topologically nontrivial. These results indicate that the Nb3Sb may be a promising platform to investigate the relationship between XMR, topology and superconductivity.

# II. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND CALCULATIONS

Nb3Sb single crystals were grown by a chemical vapor transport method. Stoichiometrical ratio of high purity Nb powders (99.999%) and Sb powders (99.999%) were sealed in an evacuated quartz tube with 10 mg/cm<sup>3</sup> iodine as a transport agent, then heated for two weeks in a tube furnace with a temperature gradient of 1220 - 1120 K. Silver grey crystals with typical dimensions 1.0 × 1.0 × 0.2 mm<sup>3</sup> were obtained at the cold end of the tube. The composition was confirmed to be Nb : Sb = 3 : 1 using the energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer (EDXS). The crystal structure was determined by a powder x-ray diffractometer (XRD, PANalytical), created by grinding pieces of crystals [see Fig. 1(b)]. It was confirmed that Nb3Sb crystallizes in a cubic structure (space group Pm¯3n, No. 223). The lattice parameters, a = b = c = 5.26(2) ˚A were obtained using Rietveld refinement to the XRD data (weighted profile factor Rwp = 7.62%, and the goodness-of-fit χ <sup>2</sup> = 2.556), as shown in Fig. 1(b). Electrical resistivity (ρxx), Hall resistivity (ρxy), and magnetization measurements were carried out using a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS - 9 T) or Quantum Design magnetic property measurement system (MPMS - 7 T).

**Caption:** Figure 1 illustrates the crystal structure and X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Nb3Sb. Panel (a) shows the cubic structure of Nb3Sb with the A15 phase, highlighting the arrangement of niobium (Nb) and antimony (Sb) within the lattice. Panel (b) presents the XRD pattern for ground Nb3Sb crystals, demonstrating the fidelity of the synthesized material to the expected A15 crystalline phase. The refinement using Rietveld analysis yields lattice parameters of a = b = c = 5.26 Å, underscoring the high-quality synthesis of the sample as indicated by a weighted profile factor (Rwp) of 7.62% and a goodness-of-fit (χ²) of 2.556. These details confirm the successful creation of high-purity Nb3Sb, which is pivotal for accurate electronic property measurements and analyses.

#### III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Firstly, we discuss the longitudinal resistivity ρxx of Nb3Sb measured at various temperatures and in different magnetic fields. The resistivity measured at µ0H = 0 T [see Fig. 2(a)] exhibits a metallic behavior with ρ(2 K) = 0.29 µΩ cm, and ρ(300 K) = 18 µΩ cm, thus the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) ρ(300 K)/ρ(2 K) ∼ 62, indicating that the Nb3Sb crystal has a high quality. It was found that Nb3Sb crystal exhibits large magnetoresistance. As shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), an up-turn behavior in ρxx(T) curves is observed under applied magnetic field at

low temperatures: ρxx increases with decreasing T and then saturates. Figure 2(b) shows MR as a function of temperature at various magnetic fields, with the conventional definition MR = ∆ρ <sup>ρ</sup>(0) = [ <sup>ρ</sup>(H)−ρ(0) <sup>ρ</sup>(0) ] × 100%. The normalized MR, shown in the inset of Fig. 2(b), has the same temperature dependence for various fields, excluding the suggestion of a field-induced metal-insulator transition [\[23,](#page-4-19) [24\]](#page-4-20) at low temperatures, as discussed in our work on the topologically trivial semimetal α-WP<sup>2</sup> [\[25\]](#page-4-21), and Thoutam et al. worked on the type-II Weyl semimetal WTe<sup>2</sup> [\[26\]](#page-4-22).

Figure 3(a) shows the MR as a function of field at different temperatures. The measured MR is large at low temperatures, reaching 717% at 2 K and 9 T, and having no sign of saturation up to the highest field (9 T) applied in our measurements. In addition, MR can be described by the Kohler scaling law [\[27\]](#page-4-23)

$$MR = \frac{\Delta \rho\_{xx}(T, H)}{\rho\_0(T)} = \alpha (H/\rho\_0)^m. \tag{1}$$

As shown in Fig. 3(b), all the MR data measured from T = 2 to 100 K collapse onto a single straight line when plotted as MR ∼ H /ρ<sup>0</sup> curve, with α = 0.026 (µΩ cm/T)1.<sup>8</sup> and m = 1.8 obtained by fitting. The nearly quadratic field dependence of MR observed for this semimetal Nb3Sb is attributed to the perfect electronhole compensation, as evidenced by the the Hall resistivity measurements discussed below, which is a common characteristic for most of the topologically nontrivial and trivial semimetals [\[25,](#page-4-21) [28,](#page-4-24) [29\]](#page-4-25).

**Caption:** Figure 2 displays the evolution of longitudinal resistivity (ρxx) and magnetoresistive behavior in Nb3Sb. Panel (a) reports ρxx across a range of temperatures in various magnetic fields, exhibiting metallic characteristics, while the inset underscores low-temperature resistivity measurements. Panel (b) shows MR as a function of temperature, reinforced through inset data normalized to values at 2 K across magnetic field variations—implying stability against field-induced metal-insulator shifts. This resistive and magnetoresistive pathway reinforces the material’s potential for high-functioning electronic applications due to its substantial magnetoresistance and evident strengths in carrier compensation.

(b) The MR as a function of temperature measured at various magnetic fields. The inset shows the temperature dependence of MR normalized by its value at 2 K at various magnetic fields.

We then discuss the characteristics of charge carriers in Nb3Sb relying on the Hall resistivity measurements. Figure 4(a) displays ρxy(H ) measured at various temperatures. Although the linear dependence of ρxy(H ) with a positive slope indicates that the holes dominate the transport properties, it is not true for a semimetal,

**Caption:** Figure 3 (formerly depicted as Figure 2) shows the magnetoresistance (MR) behavior of Nb3Sb. Panel (a) charts the MR as a function of external magnetic field (H) at various temperatures, showing a large MR value of nearly 717% at 2 K and 9 T with no saturation observable at the maximum field. This indicates robust MR properties consistent with semimetals exhibiting perfect electron-hole compensation. Panel (b) demonstrates the MR scaled against the ratio of magnetic field H to base resistivity ρxx(0) plotted on a log scale. The MR follows a Kohler’s law, collapsing onto a single line across different temperatures, indicative of systematic scaling behaviors rooted in carrier compensation mechanisms.

Panel (b) delineates electron (n<sub>e</sub>) and hole (n<sub>h</sub>) concentrations and their mobilities (µ<sub>e</sub> and µ<sub>h</sub>) over the temperature range, noting near parity under 100 K, confirming electron-hole compensation. Panels (c)-(f) display the experimental and fitted curves of longitudinal and Hall conductivities (σ<sub>xx</sub> and σ<sub>xy</sub>) for 2 K and 10 K, illustrating the excellent agreement with the two-carrier model, thus supporting Nb3Sb’s nature as a compensated semimetal.

Panel (c) assesses the temperature dependency of FFT amplitudes relative to frequency, accompanied by a fit based on the LK theory. Panel (d) further elucidates the precision fitting of observed dHvA oscillations at 2 K within a multi-band LK formula context. These fitting exercises extract crucial parameters like effective mass, Dingle temperature, and Berry phase—a finitude thereof, roping Nb3Sb into the echelons of nontrivial topological semimetals, with potential research implications for quantum electronic devices.

 in which both electron and hole carriers coexist, as discussed by us for the MoO<sup>2</sup> [\[14\]](#page-4-10). Following the analysis of γ-MoTe<sup>2</sup> by Zhou et al. [\[30\]](#page-4-26), as well as for MoO<sup>2</sup> by ourself [\[14\]](#page-4-10), we analysed the longitudinal and Hall resistivity data using the semiclassical two-carrier model. In this model, the conductivity tensor, in the complex representation, is given by [\[1\]](#page-3-1)

$$
\sigma = \frac{en\_e\mu\_e}{1 + i\mu\_e\mu\_0H} + \frac{en\_h\mu\_h}{1 - i\mu\_h\mu\_0H}.\tag{2}
$$

σxy EXP FIT *T* = 1 0 K where n<sup>e</sup> and n<sup>h</sup> denote the electron and hole concentrations, µ<sup>e</sup> and µ<sup>h</sup> denote the mobilities of electrons and holes, respectively. From Eq. (2), the Hall conductivity σxy is the imaginary part and the longitudinal conductivity σxx is the real part as shown in the Eq. (3) and (4) [\[30\]](#page-4-26).

$$
\sigma\_{xy} = \frac{e\mu\_0 H n\_h \mu\_h^2}{1 + \mu\_h^2 \mu\_0^2 H^2} - \frac{e\mu\_0 H n\_e \mu\_e^2}{1 + \mu\_e^2 \mu\_0^2 H^2}, \tag{3}
$$

$$
\sigma\_{xx} = \frac{en\_h\mu\_h}{1 + \mu\_h^2\mu\_0^2H^2} + \frac{en\_e\mu\_e}{1 + \mu\_e^2\mu\_0^2H^2}.\tag{4}
$$

To appropriately evaluate the carrier densities and mobilities, we calculated the Hall conductivity σxy = − ρxy/(ρ 2 xx + ρ 2 xy) and the longitudinal conductivity σxx = ρxx/(ρ 2 xx + ρ 2 xy) using the experimentally observed Hall resistivity ρxy (H ) and longitudinal resistivity ρxx (H ). Then, we fit both σxy(H ) and σxx(H ) data using Eq. (3) and (4).

Figures 4(c)-(f) display the fits of both the σxx (H ) and σxy (H ) at T = 2 K and 10 K, respectively. The excellent agreement between our experimental data and the two-carrier model over a broad range of temperatures confirms the coexistence of electrons and holes in Nb3Sb. Figure 4(b) shows the ne, nh, µ<sup>e</sup> and µ<sup>h</sup> values obtained by the fitting over the temperature range 2 − 300 K. It is remarkable that the n<sup>e</sup> and n<sup>h</sup> values are almost the same below 100 K, such as at 2 K, n<sup>e</sup> = 1.83 × 10<sup>19</sup> cm−<sup>3</sup> , and n<sup>h</sup> = 1.79 × 10<sup>19</sup> cm−<sup>3</sup> . These results indicate that the MR in Nb3Sb semimetal indeed results from the perfect compensation of the two kinds of charge carriers, similar to that observed in many trivial and nontrivial topological semimetals [\[1,](#page-3-1) [31](#page-4-27)[–35\]](#page-4-28). Due to the existence of phonon thermal scattering at higher temperatures, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b), it is obvious that both µ<sup>e</sup> and µ<sup>h</sup> decrease notably with increasing temperature. It is worth noting that hole mobility µ<sup>h</sup> is larger than µ<sup>e</sup> at lower temperatures, such as at 2 K, µ<sup>h</sup> = 6.2 × 10<sup>3</sup> cm2/V s, and µ<sup>e</sup> = 1.9 × 10<sup>3</sup> cm2/V s.

Finally, to obtain additional information on the electronic structure, we measured the dHvA quantum oscillations in the isothermal magnetization, M (H ), for a Nb3Sb crystal up to 7 T for the H k c axis orientation. After subtracting a smooth background from the M (H ) data at each temperature, the periodic oscillations are visible in 1/H, as shown in Fig. 5(a). From the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) analysis, we derived four basic frequencies [Fig. 5(b)]. In general, the oscillatory magnetization of three dimensional (3D) system can be described by the Lifshitz-Kosevich (LK) formula [\[36,](#page-4-29) [37\]](#page-4-30) with the Berry phase [\[38\]](#page-4-31):

$$
\Delta M \propto -B^{1/2} R\_T R\_D R\_S \sin[2\pi (F/B - \gamma - \delta)], \quad (5)
$$

$$R\_T = \alpha T \mu / B \sinh(\alpha T \mu / B),\tag{6}$$

$$R\_D = \exp(-\alpha T\_D \mu / B),\tag{7}$$

$$R\_S = \cos(\pi g \mu/2). \tag{8}$$

where µ is the ratio of effective cyclotron mass m<sup>∗</sup> to free electron mass m0. T <sup>D</sup> is the Dingle temperature, and α = (2π 2 kBm0)/(~e). The phase factor δ = 1/8 or − 1/8 for three dimensional system. The effective mass m<sup>∗</sup> can be obtained by fitting the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude RT(T), as shown in Fig. 5(c). For F<sup>β</sup> = 79 T, the obtained m<sup>∗</sup> is 0.17m0. Using the fitted m<sup>∗</sup> as a known parameter, we can further fit the oscillation patterns at a given temperatures [e.g., T = 2 K, see Fig. 5(d)] to the LK formula with the frequency, from which quantum mobility and the Berry phase φ<sup>B</sup> can be extracted. The fitted Dingle temperature T <sup>D</sup> is of 8.0 K, which corresponds to the quantum relaxation time τ<sup>q</sup> = ~/(2πkBTD) being of 0.15 ps, and quantum

mobility µ<sup>q</sup> = eτ/m<sup>∗</sup> being of 1551 cm2/V s. The LK fit also yields a phase factor − γ− δ of 0.82, in which γ = 1 2 − φ<sup>B</sup> 2π and the Berry phase φ<sup>B</sup> is determined to be 0.89π for δ = 1/8 and 0.39π for δ = − 1/8. As is well known, topological nontrivial materials requires a nontrivial π Berry phase, while for the trivial materials, the Berry phase equals 0 or 2π . In our sample, the Berry phase is close to the π, so it is a topological nontrivial materials. All the results for other frequencies are listed in Table I.

## IV. SUMMARY

In summary, Nb3Sb with the A15 structure have been studied in detail by longitudinal resistivity, Hall resistivity, and dHvA oscillations in magnetization measurements. It is found that the MR exhibits a field induced up-turn behavior with unsaturated H <sup>1</sup>.<sup>8</sup> dependence, which is believed to arise from the carrier compensation, as evidenced by the Hall resistivity results. We also obtained the non-zero Berry phase from the dHvA oscillations, indicating the nontrivial topology of band structure in Nb3Sb. Therefore, it is vital to study the topological nature of Nb3Sb in superconducting state in future studies.
