# **ABSTRACT**

A comparative study of magnetic behavior in a DC magnetic field up to 19 Tesla has been undertaken on different Nb3Sn samples, i.e. single crystals, polycrystal samples and multifilamentary wires. From the 1st and 3rd harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility a peak effect was experimentally observed in the single crystal and in the polycrystal, whereas this phenomenon is absent in the measured wires. The corresponding H vs T phase diagram reveals a different behavior between wires on one hand and polycrystalline and single crystal samples on the other. In particular, from the 3rd harmonics it has been observed that vortex thermally activated flux creep phenomena are relevant in the wires, whereas the static critical state models are more appropriate to describe single crystals.

# **INTRODUCTION**

 Nb3Sn is one of the most attractive materials for the manufacture of high-field superconducting magnets. Since 1954, when superconductivity was observed for the first time [1], a strong interest has been devoted to this compound. Nb3Sn is a BCS low Tc superconductor, crystallizing in the A15 structure [2], with a superconducting critical temperature Tc = 18 K [1]. A structural transformation, occurring in a very narrow composition range only (at stoichiometry) [3], has been detected in pure samples (single crystals [4] and some polycrystals [3, 5]), from a high temperature cubic phase to a low temperature tetragonal phase [3]. Nevertheless, most of the studies on this compound are aimed at multifilamentary wires. In particular, the fabrication methods [6,7,8], the mechanical effects (effects of the stress on Tc and critical current density, Jc [9]) and the superconducting properties [10, 11] (enhancing of Jc and Bc2 with addition of different elements) have been widely studied. In spite of this large scientific production, the field/temperature (H-T) phase diagram in Nb3Sn is not completely clear. The most important result on this subject has been obtained by Suenaga [12], who detected an irreversibility line, quite distinct from the Tc-line, in a commercial multifilamentary wire. Nevertheless, the H-T phase diagram in single crystals and polycrystals has not been analyzed in detail.

In this work, a comparative study on the magnetic properties of a single crystal, a polycrystal and a bronze route multifilamentary wire has been analyzed, by using both the 1st and the 3rd harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility. The corresponding H-T phase diagrams have been obtained both by a traditional way (from 1st harmonic measurements). In addition, we propose here a new method, based on the analysis of the 3rd harmonics.

# **EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUE**

In the measurements of the harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility, a linear magnetic response corresponds to the detection of the 1st harmonics only, whereas nonlinear magnetic properties are associated to the existence of higher harmonics [18, 19].

The measurement reported in this paper have been performed by a home-made susceptometer equipped with two different lock-in amplifiers devoted to the detection respectively of the 1st and 3rd harmonics as a function of the temperature (*T*) in the range [4.5-120 K], the DC magnetic field up to 19 Tesla, the frequency (ν) from 10 to 103 Hz, and the amplitude (*hAC*) up to ~ 300 Oe of the AC magnetic field. In particular here we report harmonics measured at a fixed ν = 107 Hz and *hAC* = 128 Oe, at various DC fields, in the Zero Field Cooling configuration, acquired for increasing temperature. Both the AC and the

**Caption:** Figure 1 displays the real part of the 1st harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility, denoted as χ'₁(T), for a single crystal of Nb3Sn at various DC magnetic fields. The measurements were performed with an AC magnetic field amplitude of 128 Oe and frequency of 107 Hz. This figure shows the linear response of the magnetic susceptibility, which, in this context, is utilized to identify the presence of the Peak Effect—a significant thermal hysteresis observed above 3 Tesla. This effect manifests as a dip in χ'₁(T) caused by a peak in the critical current density indicating a transition in the vortex structure from a disordered phase to a more ordered Bragg Glass phase. The results enhance understanding of the vortex dynamics and critical phenomena in type-II superconductors like Nb3Sn. This contributes to the broader context of improving performance in superconducting applications by stabilizing the vortex lattice under high magnetic field conditions .

**Caption:** Figure 2 presents the temperature dependence of the real part of the 1st harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility χ'₁(T) for a polycrystalline Nb3Sn sample, measured across various DC fields. With fields applied parallel to the sample’s longer dimension, the data reveal a dip in susceptibility after 3 Tesla, similar to that observed in the single crystal. This dip correlates to the Peak Effect, indicating a transition linked with an increase in vortices' pinning force as temperature increases. The measurements were performed with an AC magnetic field amplitude of 128 Oe. These findings underscore the importance of polycrystalline structures in modulating superconducting transition phenomena, with implications for the material's application in high-field magnet technology .

# **EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS**

We analyzed different Nb3Sn samples, in particular: a single crystal, a polycrystal and a bronze route multifilamentary wire. More details about the analyzed samples are reported elsewhere [13], [14] and [8].

# **1st harmonics analysis**

 FIGURES 1, 2 and 3 show the real part of the 1st harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility as a function of the temperature, (*T* ) ' χ <sup>1</sup> , at various DC fields, for the single crystal, the polycrystalline sample and the multifilamentary wire, respectively.

A dip in ( ) *T*' χ 1 has been detected in both the single crystal and in the polycrystalline sample for fields higher than 3 Tesla, up to a threshold field (10 Tesla for the polycrystal, 13 Tesla for the single crystal). This dip is directly associated to a peak in the critical current density, namely the "Peak Effect" [15, 16]. On the contrary, no dip has been detected in the measurements performed on the wire. In FIGURE 3, at T ~ 9 K in zero field it is also possible to observe an additional superconducting transition, associated with Nb in the wire [8], that it is not present any more at higher fields Hc2(Nb) being under 1 Tesla [17].

The transition width is almost field independent in the single and in the polycrystalline samples for H > 3 Tesla, also at high fields, where the Peak Effect cannot be detected anymore. On the contrary, it becomes larger for increasing DC fields in the wire (as it generally occurs in the samples where no peak effect can be detected).

**Caption:** Figure 3 illustrates the real part of the 1st harmonics χ'₁(T) for a bronze route multifilamentary Nb3Sn wire, recorded at various DC magnetic fields. In contrast to single and polycrystalline samples, no Peak Effect is observed here, highlighting the distinct magnetic characteristics of composite wire samples. This is significant as it reflects the uniformity in the critical current distribution across the wire’s filaments, facilitating reliable high-field superconductor applications. The data reveal a consistent magnetic transition without the complex pinning phenomena seen in crystalline forms, indicating potentially stable performance under varied magnetic conditions for multifilamentary superconductors .

# **3rd harmonics analysis**

 We found that the common features between the polycristalline and the single crystal, opposite to the observed magnetic behavior in the wire, can be better evidenced by the analysis of the 3rd harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility.

The temperature dependence of the real part of the 3rd harmonics, ( ) ' χ<sup>3</sup> *T* , at various DC fields, is illustrated in FIGURES 4, 5 and 6 for the three analyzed samples. The general features of the nonlinear magnetic response in the single and the polycrystalline samples are similar. In particular, ( ) ' χ<sup>3</sup> *T* is characterized in both the samples by a single positive peak near Tc, at fields lower than 3 Tesla, where no peak effect has been observed in the 1st harmonics. Two positive peaks can be identified at higher DC fields (corresponding to the

**Caption:** Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the real part of the 3rd harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility, χ'₃(T), measured from a single crystal Nb3Sn under various DC fields. This nonlinear response is crucial for identifying the two-peak structure at higher fields, with one peak near the superconducting transition temperature Tc being field-independent and another decreasing with increasing field. These peaks reflect complex vortex lattice dynamics crucial for understanding high-field superconductivity phenomena. Such insights are pivotal for advancing high-field mulitifilamentary superconductor technologies .

**Caption:** Figure 5 depicts the real part of the 3rd harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility, χ'₃(T), for a polycrystalline Nb3Sn sample across various DC fields. The measurements capture a temperature-dependent non-linear magnetic response characterized by a singular positive peak at Tc, and minor deviations at lower fields. These responses reveal differences in vortex dynamics compared to single crystals, underscoring the utility of polycrystals in probing subtle superconducting state changes. The findings inform fabrication processes aiming to leverage the predictably of superconducting phases in polycrystalline materials .

peak effect detected by the 1st harmonic): the first one, near Tc, is almost field independent, whereas the other one tends to decrease for increasing fields and disappears at a certain DC field, where the peak effect cannot be detected any more in the 1st harmonics. The positive peak near Tc, instead, can be always observed, up to the maximum available field (19 Tesla).

 In the wire sample, only one positive peak near Tc has been detected in ( ) ' χ<sup>3</sup> *T* curves,

**Caption:** Figure 6 presents the temperature dependence of the real part of the 3rd harmonics χ'₃(T) in a bronze route multifilamentary Nb3Sn wire, under different DC fields. This visualization reveals the presence of a positive peak, whose height increases with field intensity, indicative of field-dependent flux dynamics. This behavior contrasts with that seen in crystal samples, alluding to the influence of composite material structures on wave attenuation and dynamic flux lines, thus critical for engineering improvements in superconductor wire technologies .

that is field dependent, e.g. its height grows for increasing field, contrarily to what observed in the polycrystal and in the single crystal.

 Although some common features between the polycrystal and the single crystal have been evidenced, it is possible to observe some differences, too. In particular, we noticed that the relative heights of the peaks are different depending on the samples: in the single crystal, the height of the peak near Tc is always lower than the second peak height, contrary to what happens in the bulk. The reason of this difference is not clear and theoretical/numerical investigations are needed. Moreover, we detected in the polycrystal sample a small negative bump at low fields (see H = 1 Tesla in FIGURE 5), in a temperature range far from Tc, absent in the single crystal. The peak is not in agreement with the static critical state models [18] predicting only non-negative values for ( ) ' χ<sup>3</sup> *T* , but

it can be explained in terms of the vortex dynamic phenomena [19] determined by thermally activated creep phenomena. Nevertheless, these dynamic phenomena tend to disappear for increasing fields. In contrast, the negative bump at low temperatures is always present in the multifilamentary wire (see FIGURE 6), its height growing in absolute value for increasing fields. This behavior is similar to that observed in the high Tc superconductors [19] and can be associated to flux creep phenomena [20].

# **H-T Phase Diagram**

In FIGURES 7 and 8 the H-T phase diagrams have been reported for both the single crystal and the polycristalline sample, respectively. They have been obtained by plotting the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and the temperature corresponding to the ( ) *T*' χ 1 dip local minimum (Tp), determined by 1st harmonics measurements, at various DC fields. The presence of a Peak Effect indicates that a transition between a Disordered Phase and the Bragg Glass Phase is occurring, following T. Giamarchi [21]. In the region between the Tc-line and the Tp-line a disordered phase can be detected, whereas the H-T region for temperatures lower than Tp is characterized by the Bragg Glass phase.

**Caption:** Figure 7 illustrates the H-T phase diagram for a Nb3Sn single crystal, constructed using data from both 1st and 3rd harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility. The diagram demarcates regions depicting different phases, such as the disordered and Bragg Glass phases, characterized by a Peak Effect. This highlights the interplay of vortices and lattice within varying field regions, informing phase stability and material physics that are essential for designing superconducting devices operating under extreme conditions .

**Caption:** Figure 8 presents the H-T phase diagram of a polycrystalline Nb3Sn sample, indicating zones of distinct phase behavior including disordered, and Bragg Glass phases, as deduced from both 1st and 3rd harmonics measurements. The manifestation of the Peak Effect and its associated transitions offers comprehensive insights for enhancing material properties and superconducting efficiency pivotal for future high-field applications.


**FIGURE 8**. H-T phase diagram in the Nb3Sn polycrystal.

In this work, it was found that the 1st harmonics is not appropriate to detect the transition between the Bragg and the disordered phase in the low temperatures/high fields range. For this reason, the ( ) \* ' *T* χ3 has also been plotted, corresponding to the onset temperature of the positive peak near Tc, in the real part of the 3rd harmonics. It has been already observed [22] that ( ) \* ' *T* χ3 can be detected up to the highest available field, giving up the possibilities to have an agreement with the theoretical models [21, 23] predicting the existence of the Disordered/Bragg phase transition at all the fields. The irreversibility line [24], obtained as the onset of the 3rd harmonics [25], corresponds to the Tc line, so for simplicity it has not been plotted on the phase diagrams reported in Fig. 7 and 8.

In contrast, a clearly distinct irreversibility line can be identified in the H-T phase diagram of the wire, as shown in FIGURE 9. Nevertheless, no Bragg phase has been detected in the multifilamentary wire. The obtained phase diagram for the wire is in agreement to what reported in literature [12], but is different from both the phase diagrams

**Caption:** Figure 9 displays the H-T phase diagram for a bronze route multifilamentary wire, lacking visible Bragg Glass phase transitions but marking an irreversibility line. This suggests enhanced thermal flux creep phenomena typical in wire architecture, aiding the understanding of multifilamentary materials’ performance under operational stress, and directing developmental strategies for wire-based superconducting technologies.

of the single and the polycrystalline samples.

# **CONCLUSIONS**

The magnetic response of three different Nb3Sn samples (a single crystal, a polycrystalline sample and a bronze route multifilamentary wire) has been analyzed by measurements of the 1st and 3rd harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility in presence of a static DC field up to 19 Tesla. We observed a common behavior for the single crystal and the polycrystalline samples: a Peak Effect has been identified by 1st harmonics measurements at low fields, and a Bragg Glass phase has been detected up to the maximum available field, by 3rd harmonics. Moreover it has not been possible to distinguish an irreversibility line from the Tc-line, in both the samples. A different behavior has been observed in the wire, where an irreversibility line has been detected, in agreement to that reported in the literature [12], but it has not been possible to identify a Bragg Glass Phase. Further differences have also been observed in the non-linear magnetic response, detected by 3rd harmonics measurements; in particular, the wire behavior showed a negative bump in ( ) ' χ<sup>3</sup> *T* which cannot be described by the critical state models.
