**Caption:** Figure 2 illustrates a comparison of result sets A and B, as represented by bar graphs. The x-axis denotes the various parameters, while the y-axis shows the obtained values. The graph indicates a significant difference between the two result sets, highlighting that condition A yielded twice the output compared to condition B, underlining the parameter influence on the final output.
