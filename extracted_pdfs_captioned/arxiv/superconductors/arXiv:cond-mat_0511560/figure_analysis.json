      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates the upper critical field *Hc2*(T) as a function of temperature determined from resistive measurements of the superconducting transition. It features three plots: (a) and (b) depict data for samples prepared from binary Nb3Sn powders milled for 2 and 6 hours, respectively, while plot (c) corresponds to ternary samples with 2% Ti substitution, milled for 2 hours. The x-axis denotes temperature in Kelvin (K), and the y-axis represents the magnetic field in Tesla (T). Data points and their accompanying error bars indicate 50% of the normal state resistivity and the variation from 10% to 90%, correspondingly. Least-squares fits to the data points are presented with dashed lines. This visualization highlights how the slope of *Hc2* decreases under more intensive annealing conditions for a set milling time and composition. Comparatively, the plot shows that the disorder introduced by varying milling and annealing conditions non-trivially affects the superconducting properties, emphasizing how disorder enhances *Hc2* responses beyond the levels achieved via alloying alone. This provides significant insight into optimizing Nb3Sn for high-field applications such as in superconducting magnets, with potential increases in *Hc2* up to 35 T for disorder-enriched samples compared to typical Ti-alloyed Nb3Sn superconductors .",
