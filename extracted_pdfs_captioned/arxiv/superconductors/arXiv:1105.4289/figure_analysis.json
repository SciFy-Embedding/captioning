      "caption": "Figure 1 presents a comprehensive log-log plot of the discontinuity in specific heat (ΔC/Tc) versus the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) for various superconductors, including conventional elements, A-15 compounds, FePn/Ch superconductors, and heavy Fermion superconductors. The data points for elemental superconductors are shown as black solid circles, A-15 compounds as blue open squares, FePn/Ch superconductors as various other markers, and heavy Fermion superconductors as red X's. The right axis and upper axes are scaled differently to accommodate the broader ΔC ranges of heavy Fermion superconductors. The slope of each line represents a power-law relationship, with elemental structures showing ΔC/Tc ∝ Tc^0.94, A-15 structures showing ΔC/Tc ∝ Tc^0.82, and a distinctly steeper slope for FePn/Ch at ΔC/Tc ∝ 0.083Tc^1.89. This figure elaborates the distinction between FePn/Ch and both conventional and heavy Fermion superconductors, underscoring a different superconducting mechanism in FePn/Ch which points to non-Fermi liquid behavior or alternative interaction effects beyond electron-phonon coupling.",

      "caption": "Figure 2 presents the specific heat capacity divided by temperature (C/T) for BaFe2(As0.7P0.3)2 as a function of temperature near the superconducting transition. The plot displays data points representing the precision measurement required due to the significant phonon contribution, with an absolute error margin indicated by the black error bar. A specific singularity is depicted by the idealized, sharp vertical line at the transition temperature Tc = 28.2 K, demonstrating a significant ΔC/Tc of 38.5 mJ/molK^2. The adjacent sloped red lines fit the data above and below the transition, its width measuring approximately 1.3 K, indicative of bulk properties consistent with susceptibility measurements. These results align with the Bud'ko, Ni and Canfield (BNC) established pattern for iron-based superconductors showing a ΔC/Tc ∝ Tc^2 relationship, providing a comparative benchmark against other FePh/Ch superconductors.",
