      "caption": "Figure 3: (a) The superfluid density of a pristine V3Si crystal is depicted using different color-coded lines. Symbols represent experimental data, while the blue and green lines correspond to partial superfluid densities, ρ1 and ρ2, derived from a least squares fitting. The orange line behind these data indicates an excellent agreement with the experimental results, confirming the model of ρs = γρ1 + (1 − γ) ρ2. Fitting parameters include ν11 = 0.700, ν22 = 0.578, ν12 = 0.005, and γ = 0.175. (b) The panel shows the best-fit solutions of the self-consistent gap equations, giving zero-temperature gap ratios of Δ1/Tc = 1.787 and Δ2/Tc = 1.005. These values support the presence of two nearly decoupled gaps, a characteristic of s++ superconductors. This highlights the application of the γ-model in describing the characteristics of s++ superconductivity in V3Si. This figure emphasizes the significance of the superfluid density fitting within the context of studying two-band superconductivity models in V3Si .",

The main plot shows an increase in Δλ with decreasing temperature, indicating superconducting transition. The inset focuses on the low-temperature region, revealing a pronounced feature at around 10 K associated with the onset of a second superconducting gap. This provides evidence for the existence of two superconducting gaps in V3Si, a fundamental observation for understanding its complex superconducting properties .",
