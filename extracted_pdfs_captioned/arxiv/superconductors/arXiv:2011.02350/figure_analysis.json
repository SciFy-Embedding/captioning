      "caption": "Figure 1 displays zero-field muon spin relaxation (ZF-µSR) spectra for the compounds Ti3Ir and Ti3Sb. The plotted spectra above and below the critical temperature (Tc) are fitted using a static Kubo Toyabe function, suggesting no observed change in asymmetry across the superconducting transition, indicative of preserved time-reversal symmetry in both compounds. These findings are crucial for classifying Ti3Ir and Ti3Sb as potential time-reversal symmetry-preserving topological superconductors, aligning with similar properties exhibited by NbC and TaC .",
