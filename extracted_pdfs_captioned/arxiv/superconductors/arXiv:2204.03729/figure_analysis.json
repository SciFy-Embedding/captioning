      "caption": "Figure 4 shows three-dimensional contour plots of Vanadium (V) spectra with temperature on the y-axis and frequency on the x-axis. Panel (a) presents the pre-transformed, cubic phase spectra, with dashed lines indicating spectral peaks for V chains parallel to the magnetic field (H), and triangles marking peaks for perpendicular chains. A red arrow indicates the temperature-invariant peak for copper. In panel (b), the spectra illustrate dramatic changes near the Martensitic Transformation (MT); cubic phase lines disappear (blue arrows), while tetragonal phase lines emerge (red arrows) as temperature decreases. The discontinuation of cubic phase and the emergence of tetragonal phase between Tm (21 K) and Tc (13 K) demonstrate the coupling of structural changes with superconductivity onset. This figure is significant for showcasing the detailed temperature evolution of spectral lines, providing insights into the microscopic mechanisms governing the MT in V3Si.",

The graph shows spectra for chains of atoms both perpendicular (green arrows) and parallel (black arrows) to the applied magnetic field (H), illustrating expected spacings between nuclear quadrupole resonance peaks. The peak for 63Cu is highlighted in light blue. The inset provides an image of the NMR coil arrangement on a goniometer stage, indicating experimental setup precision to improve spectral resolution. This figure is critical for validating temperature-invariant quadrupole frequencies critical to understanding the pre-transformed state and aiding the analysis of MT.",

The graph plots the lattice parameter against temperature, with a marked transition around Tm â‰ˆ 20.5 K. The critical c/a ratio of 1.0022 is noted, distinguishing the tetragonal from the cubic phase. These calculations and experimental results provide foundational insight into the anisotropic structural changes that accompany the martensitic transformation in V3Si.",

Panel (a) presents resistivity data for the sample labeled 'MP3', highlighting a clear drop at Tc and a field-independent inflection near Tm, indicating the Martensitic Transition (MT). Panel (b) summarizes field dependency of Tc and Tm, pinpointing the study field at 6.7 T. Panel (c) contrasts this with a sample of lower purity, lacking an MT signature. These results emphasize the MT's sensitivity to crystal purity, a key finding underlining the necessity for high-quality crystals in studying superconducting properties.",
