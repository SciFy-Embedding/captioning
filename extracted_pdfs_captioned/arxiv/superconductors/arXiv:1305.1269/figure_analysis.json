      "caption": "Figure 4 depicts the effect of overpressure heat treatment (HT) on the engineering current density (JE) of Bi-2212 superconducting wires. Panel (a) presents a graph illustrating JE at 4.2 K and 5 T as a function of total pressure applied during HT, with a significant increase in JE observed with higher pressures. The X-ray tomography images in panels (b) and (c) compare wire porosity before and after applying 100 bar overpressure, respectively, highlighting the elimination of extensive porosity seen at 1 bar in (b) and demonstrating a dense cross-section at 100 bar in (c). This figure demonstrates the critical role of overpressure in enhancing superconducting performance, vital for advancing high-field magnet technology by significantly increasing JE without compromising wire integrity.",

      "caption": "Figure 5 illustrates a high-field demonstration coil constructed with 30 meters of 1.4 mm diameter Bi-2212 wire, designed to operate in a 31.2 T background magnetic field and generate an additional 2.6 T, achieving a total field of 33.8 T. The coil underwent heat treatment at 10 bar overpressure (OP), and despite the lower pressure compared to ideal conditions, it demonstrated robust performance by withstanding multiple quenches without damage. The coil achieved a maximum quench current of 388 A, translating to an engineering current density (JE) of 252 A/mm² at a total field strength of 33.8 T. This operational test highlights the feasibility and resilience of Bi-2212 coils for use in high-magnetic-field applications.",

The dataset shows that OP-treated Bi-2212 offers improved performance due to its reduced bubble density during heat treatment, particularly when compared to conventional conductors, including Nb3Sn which falls off quickly beyond 20 T due to its critical field limitations. This graphical comparison underscores Bi-2212's potential to substitute for current technologies in high-magnetic-field applications, with the round-wire form facilitating more effective utilization and cabling.",
