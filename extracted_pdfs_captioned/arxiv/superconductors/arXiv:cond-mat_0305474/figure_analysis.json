Top: High resistivity (ρ(40 K) = 220 μΩcm) film showing c-axis textured 'brick-wall' structure with indistinct MgB2 and MgO grains approximately 10-20 nm in size. Middle: Atomic resolution image of a highly strained and buckled Mg structure, especially along the c-axis, indicated by varying intensity of bright Mg spots. Bottom: More perfect structure of a low resistivity epitaxial film (ρ(40 K) = 7 μΩcm) with much less distortion.
