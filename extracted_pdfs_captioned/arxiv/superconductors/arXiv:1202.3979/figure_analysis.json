      "caption": "The figure illustrates the neutron isofluence distribution within a detector for each bunch crossing in a proposed Muon Collider design. The x-axis represents spatial distribution in centimeters (z, cm), while the color gradient from red to blue reflects varying levels of neutron fluence, with higher values closer to the center. This visualization provides critical insight into managing the radiation environment by indicating areas within the detector that experience the highest neutron fluence. This is significant for optimizing shielding and minimizing radiation damage, essential to maintaining detector integrity and performance.",

The x-axis indicates spatial distribution, while the color intensity demonstrates levels of absorbed dose. High-intensity zones (in red) close to the center indicate significant energy deposition due to incoming particles, crucial for predicting the thermal and radiation load the IR dipoles might experience. Understanding these profiles is vital to ensure the safe operation of superconducting magnets at low temperatures necessary to maintain their superconducting state.",
