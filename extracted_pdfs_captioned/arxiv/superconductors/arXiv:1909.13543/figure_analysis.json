      "caption": "Figure 2 illustrates the scaling behavior of the normalized critical current under load (I<sup>c</sup>load/Ic0) relative to the corresponding current after stress unload (I<sup>c</sup>unload/Ic0) for measurements at T = 4.2 K, B = 19 T. The dataset includes results from multiple tests on PIT wires from different billets employing various impregnation schemes. This scaling phenomenon signifies that, regardless of impregnation type, there exists a consistent relation between the critical current reductions at differing stress stages, attributed to the intrinsic response of the Nb3Sn filaments to local stresses.",

The stars represent theoretical predictions based on a model using Bc2 data. This figure underscores the capability of experimental data for single wires to analogously reflect behaviors observed in complete cables, thus allowing extrapolation of insights into real cable performance.",

The plot highlights differences in behavior under load (solid symbols) and after unload (open symbols). The irreversible stress limits are marked by dashed lines. The comparison between 16 T and 19 T indicates that the critical current's stress sensitivity significantly differs with magnetic field intensity, revealing key insights into the electromechanical limits of Nb3Sn superconductors.",

      "caption": "Figure 1 depicts the dependence of the critical current (Ic) normalized to the critical current at zero applied stress (Ic0) on the transverse stress at T = 4.2 K and B = 19 T for a 1-mm Powder-In-Tube (PIT) Nb3Sn wire. The data includes three experimental configurations: (a) wire bare and impregnated with epoxy type-L, (b) wire bare and impregnated with Stycast, and (c) wire in a glass-fiber sleeve impregnated with epoxy type-L. Solid symbols represent measurements under load, while open symbols portray data after unload. Dashed lines indicate the irreversible stress limits, which signify the point beyond which the wire's critical current is permanently reduced. This figure demonstrates that increasing the rigidity of the impregnation material delays the onset of irreversible reduction in the wireâ€™s critical current, highlighting the influence of impregnation rigidity on electromechanical performance.",
