      "caption": "The figure presents the normalized pinning force (F_p/F_p,max) against the reduced magnetic field parameter (B/B_c2) for a Nb3Sn wire manufactured by Oxford Instruments (OST) with a stainless steel (SS) jacket. The data are plotted for different applied strains (ε), indicated by various symbols such as squares, triangles, and stars representing distinct strain levels ranging from ε_0 to ε_max. The uniform curve delineated by these data points indicates that the pinning mechanism remains unaffected by the application of uniaxial tensile strain. This observation confirms that variations in superconductor performance under strain are primarily due to changes in the upper critical field (B_c2), rather than modifications in the pinning mechanism itself, which is significant for understanding the strain dependencies of superconductor properties .",
