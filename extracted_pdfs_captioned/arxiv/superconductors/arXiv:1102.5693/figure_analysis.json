      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates the nuclear spin lattice relaxation rate, 1/133T1T, for the T' site of the fcc-Cs3C60 phase under varying pressure conditions. The horizontal axis represents temperature (T) in Kelvin (K), while the vertical axis shows the relaxation rate in units of (s^−1K^−1). Different pressures ranging from 0.5 to 9 kbar are indicated by distinct symbols. The transition from a superconducting (SC) state to the paramagnetic Mott state is marked by dashed lines indicating Tc, the critical temperature. The graph reveals a departure from the constant Korringa value as the temperature increases, highlighting magnetic fluctuations near the Mott transition. The results underscore the effect of pressure on superconductivity and Mott transition in fulleride compounds, providing insights into the strong electron correlations involved .",
