      "caption": "Figure 7 illustrates the distortion energies for orthorhombically distorted A15 structures, specifically focusing on V3Si, V3Ge, and Nb3Sn. The y-axis represents the distortion energy in millielectronvolts per unit cell (meV/cell), while the x-axis displays the squared orthorhombic distortion parameter (1008)². The plot includes both unrelaxed (open squares) and relaxed (filled circles) calculations. The results demonstrate that allowing for sublattice relaxation significantly decreases the distortion energy, particularly as the distortion increases, implying that these compounds are energetically unstable in their ideal cubic A15 structure at absolute zero temperature (T=0). The distortion energy reduction indicates intrinsic instability against orthorhombic shear, with Nb3Sn showing the greatest instability.",

      "caption": "Figure 7 also depicts distortion energies for tetragonally distorted A15 structures, again focusing on V3Si, V3Ge, and Nb3Sn. The y-axis shows distortion energy in meV/cell and the x-axis portrays the tetragonal distortion parameter (100(c/a-1)). The graph includes both unrelaxed (open squares) and relaxed (filled circles) data points. The relaxed energies form a double-well structure, representing significant energy reduction upon sublattice relaxation, crucial for understanding their structural stability. These findings reflect how the structural phase transitions (c/a > 1 for V3Si and c/a < 1 for Nb3Sn) align with observed experimental data, showcasing the weakened stability of V3Ge potentially due to sample imperfections.",

      "caption": "Figure 13 presents a schematic diagram comparing ideal (c=a) and tetragonally distorted (c≠a) A15 crystal structures, focusing on compounds with formula A6B2. In this structure, B atoms form a body-centered cubic lattice, while A atoms align in linear chains on each cubic face. Arrows indicate allowed internal freedom degrees corresponding to permissible sublattice relaxations in tetragonally distorted A15 structures. The visualization underscores the structural flexibility related to sublattice relaxations, highlighting how tetragonal distortions are accommodated within the A15 framework, playing a crucial role in the compounds' phase stability and elastic properties.",
