      "caption": "The SEM micrograph illustrates a Nb3Sn sample surface that has been mechanically polished for 30 hours using wooden spheres and a colloidal abrasive suspension. The images show microscopic scratches and cracks on the surface, with a square hole cut into the surface to reveal a cross section of one of the cracks. These observations demonstrate that cracks penetrate deep into the film. This figure highlights the detrimental effects of the wooden sphere polishing method on the integrity of the Nb3Sn film, which could critically affect the superconducting characteristics and performance of SRF cavities. Such findings are significant as they emphasize the need for alternative polishing methods to avoid surface damage and improve cavity performance【4:0†temp_paper_f32288db049f1b0445ebd41947679f7e.txt】.",

      "caption": "This composite figure presents the surface roughness of Nb3Sn samples polished for varying lengths of time. The top graph depicts the root mean square (RMS) surface roughness in nanometers (nm) plotted against tumbling duration in hours for different polishing conditions: polished Nb3Sn, as-coated Nb3Sn, thin-coated Nb3Sn, and electropolished Nb. The bottom graph portrays the power spectral density (PSD) of the surface profile across different wavelengths for various polishing durations and conditions. This analysis reveals that mechanical polishing can significantly reduce surface roughness, achieving smoothness comparable to electropolished niobium surfaces. The findings are paramount for optimizing the polishing process of Nb3Sn to enhance SRF cavity performance by minimizing surface roughness .",

Image A illustrates a thin-coated sample, B presents a standard coated sample, C shows the sample after 2 hours of polishing, and D after 6 hours of polishing. These micrographs highlight the changes in surface topography due to different polishing durations. As the polishing time increases, the surface becomes smoother, indicating a reduction in surface roughness. This evolution in surface characteristics is pivotal for understanding and optimizing the polishing methods for minimizing defects in Nb3Sn films, aiming to improve the cavity performance in superconducting applications【4:1†temp_paper_f32288db049f1b0445ebd41947679f7e.txt】.",

Image A shows a sample polished using wooden spheres, which resulted in a 10 nm thick layer of disordered Nb3Sn. Image B reveals a sample polished with felt cubes, showing no such disordered layer. These findings point out the significance of the polishing media used, as the wooden sphere polishing induces disorganization within the Nb3Sn layer, potentially impacting its superconducting performance negatively. In contrast, felt cubes preserve the structural integrity of the coating, emphasizing their suitability for polishing superconducting materials【4:2†temp_paper_f32288db049f1b0445ebd41947679f7e.txt】.",

The figure visually demonstrates a clear trend of enhanced smoothness with extended polishing time. The surface peaks are flattened over time, leaving predominantly smoother areas, which indicates that controlled mechanical polishing effectively reduces surface irregularities. This reduction in surface roughness is crucial for enhancing the superconducting performance of SRF cavities, as it lowers field enhancements caused by topographic defects .",
