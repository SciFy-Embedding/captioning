      "caption": "The figure illustrates the mean-field H-T phase diagram for a type-II superconductor, depicting three distinct phases: Meissner, Mixed, and Normal. The axes plot magnetic field strength (H) against temperature (T). The Meissner phase is characterized by complete magnetic flux expulsion, occurring at low fields and temperatures. The Mixed phase shows partial penetration of the magnetic field forming vortices. The Normal phase, corresponding to high fields and temperatures, exhibits no superconductivity. The critical fields (Hc1 and Hc2) and their temperature dependences demarcate transitions between these phases. This model framework provides insight into the superconducting properties and the transitions due to changes in temperature and applied magnetic field.",
