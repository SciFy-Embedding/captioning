      "caption": "Schematic of the Simulation Geometry: The simulation geometry for the study is depicted as a cubic domain with side length X. Like-colored surfaces are assigned periodic boundary conditions while different fields are applied at red and green surfaces in the Z-direction. The illustration of the Sn-deficient island as a blue ellipsoid, with projections marked by dotted lines, indicates how the island's placement parallel to the surfaces impacts field interactions. The overarching simulation goal is to model the superconducting response and vortex behavior through changes in field application, defined by various domain boundary conditions .",
