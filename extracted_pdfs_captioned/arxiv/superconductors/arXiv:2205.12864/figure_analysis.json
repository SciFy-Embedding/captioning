      "caption": "Figure 4 illustrates the contour plots showing the heating power (a), flux jumps (b), and temperature jumps (c) for both an equivalent structure and a multi-filamentary structure. With a ramp rate of 1 A/s, field ramp rate of 0.015 T/s, and h0 = 100 W/m3·K, the study demonstrates distinct operational differences. The equivalent structure, consisting only of Nb3Sn and epoxy, experiences significant uniform heating, leading to rapid temperature increases and impacting flux jump behavior. Conversely, the actual multi-filamentary structure, integrating Nb3Sn and Cu, exhibits localized filamentary heating. The observed differences underscore the importance of studying the authentic structure for an accurate understanding of superconducting magnet behavior. The findings are critical for developing stable superconducting magnets for high-field applications, stressing the need to consider material composition and structural differences in design and analysis.【4:7†temp_paper_12b0e95a04bbd2431249054d0ae7f5d9.txt】",
