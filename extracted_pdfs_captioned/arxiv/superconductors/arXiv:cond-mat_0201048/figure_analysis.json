      "caption": "This figure displays the superconducting gap function Δ(ω) plotted against the frequency ω in meV. The solid line represents a superconducting state with a nonconstant electronic density of states (DOS), while the dashed line corresponds to a constant DOS. Key observations include nearly identical curves at both low and high energies, with deviations seen between 30 meV and 130 meV. This deviation reflects more rapid formation of high-energy features in the nonconstant DOS case, which better reproduces the experimental reduced density of states (RDOS) overswing. This finding highlights the significance of energy-dependent DOS in capturing superconducting properties in Nb3Sn.",

Solid curves denote nonconstant electronic density of states, while dashed curves indicate constant DOS. For the nonconstant DOS, ReZ can dip below 1, contrasting with constant DOS where this does not occur. The figure underscores differences in electron-phonon coupling strengths between the two DOS models, reinforcing the impact of a nonconstant DOS on superconducting behaviors.",
