      "caption": "This figure presents the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for Y2C3 and Y2C2.9B0.1 compounds, analyzed through both field-cooled (FC) and zero-field-cooled (ZFC) methods. The y-axis represents the magnetic susceptibility measured in units of 10^3 emu/g Oe, while the x-axis shows the temperature in Kelvin (K). The data includes several curves corresponding to distinct characteristics of the superconductive transition at different compositions. The trends indicate a transition point, characterized by shifts in susceptibility, around 18 K for the Y2C3 phase. The B-substituted sample demonstrates a slightly reduced transition temperature as compared to the pure phase. These findings help to underscore the influence of boron substitution and sample purity on superconducting properties, providing insights into the phase stability and potential applications of these superconductive materials.",

      "caption": "This figure depicts a magnetic phase diagram based on magnetization and transport measurements for the synthesized yttrium sesquicarbide phase. The y-axis indicates the magnetic field strength (B) in Tesla (T), while the x-axis shows temperature in Kelvin (K). Two sets of points are plotted: B_c2, the upper critical field for 18 K and 11 K phases, and T_irr, the irreversibility temperature, which collectively define the boundaries for superconductivity. Dotted lines represent theoretical extensions of these data points to estimate B_c2 values at 0 K. This graph illustrates the distinct superconducting phases, emphasizing the considerable upper critical field of the 18 K phase, comparable to robust A15-type intermetallic compounds. Such an understanding is pivotal to enhancing the phase purity and superconductive connectivity for technological development.",

      "caption": "This figure shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity for the as-synthesized yttrium sesquicarbide sample, under various applied magnetic fields ranging from 0 to 9 Tesla. The y-axis represents resistivity in milliohms per centimeter (mΩ cm), whereas the x-axis indicates temperature in Kelvin (K). The figure demonstrates two-step superconducting transitions, resulting from the coexistence of 18 K and 11 K phases. Notably, a residual resistivity is observed even at the lowest temperatures, suggesting that the volume fraction of the superconducting 18 K phase is limited. This analysis underscores the significance of magnetic fields on the transition dynamics and the sample's purity, reinforcing the necessity for improved synthesis to enhance the superconductivity of these materials.",

The x-axis represents the 2θ angles in degrees, while the y-axis depicts the relative intensity of diffracted X-rays in arbitrary units. Peaks corresponding to the Y2C3 phase are prominently visible and are consistent with the expected cubic Pu2C3-type crystal structure. Additionally, minor peaks indicate the presence of elemental Y, suggesting partial decomposition into Y metal and possible reactions with atmospheric elements. The findings are fundamental for understanding the synthesis and stability challenges of yttrium sesquicarbide, crucial for realizing its potential superconducting applications.",
