      "caption": "The illustration depicts current-sharing dynamics in a conformal winding of a tape-stack REBCO cable. Arrows indicate the Lorentz force acting on the superconducting transport system, akin to the Hall effect. The potential difference created when neighboring tapes carry different currents, along with contact resistivity Rc between adjacent tapes, leads to a displacement of current by Lorentz forces. This model employs a series-parallel L/R network to estimate the dynamic current distribution in a tape-stack cable, considering induced inductance per unit length and power-law series resistance per unit length .",

      "caption": "This figure presents two key visualizations for an 18 Tesla dipole containing a conformal REBCO insert winding. On the left, a graph displays the dependence of the critical current (Ic) on the angle between the tape face normal and the magnetic field for various field strengths at a temperature of 30 K. The plot highlights that the critical current is maximized when the magnetic field is parallel to the tape face (θ = 90°), decreasing substantially when perpendicular (θ = 0°). Notably, at a parallel orientation and 30 K, Ic approaches 2000 A/mm². On the right, the field distribution is shown in one quadrant of the 18 T dipole. The visualization reveals how the conformal REBCO insert winding is oriented to optimize field interaction and minimize quenching risks. A sextupole correction winding addresses magnetic field homogeneity and sextupole harmonics, critical for the dipole's operation in particle accelerators. Together, these visualizations support the design's strategy to maximize performance by aligning REBCO tapes with the magnetic field, crucial for achieving high-field strength with stability.",
