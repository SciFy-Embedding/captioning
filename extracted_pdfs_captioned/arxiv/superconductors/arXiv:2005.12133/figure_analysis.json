      "caption": "Figure 3. The figure illustrates the binding free energies of SnNb defects to grain boundaries, highlighting different boundary types: (112)-tilt, (110)-tilt, and (100)-twist as symbols representing antisite defects across the grain boundary. The top plot shows the variation in antisite free energy (in eV) as a function of distance from the boundary (in nm), which provides insights into structural details affecting defects' interactions with boundaries. The lower plot reveals the electronic entropy contributions to the free energies at a high electronic temperature of 5 milliHartree, emphasizing the universal interaction patterns which inform defect segregation dynamics, crucial for optimizing superconducting materials like Nb3Sn .",

Subfigure (a) shows the total density of states in bulk Nb3Sn, reflecting its superconducting properties from Wannier function basis calculations. Panels (b-d) display the d-orbital projected density of states for niobium atoms: in pure bulk (b), bulk regions (c), and the (112)-tilt boundary core (d) are plotted on the same scale for direct comparison. These data indicate a significant reduction in the Fermi-level density of states at the grain boundary core, potentially decreasing the critical temperature by over 10 K, highlighting the sensitivity of superconductivity to niobium's electronic structure .",

Subfigure (a) compares the densities from defects (SnNb, NbSn, TiNb, TaNb, CuSn) located either in the boundary core or bulk regions, with dotted lines indicating boundary inclusion and solid lines representing bulk placement. The results underscore how defects such as SnNb and CuSn significantly lower the density of states when in bulk, contrasting minimal impacts when embedded directly into boundary cores. These effects play a crucial role in understanding grain boundary engineering in Nb3Sn superconductors .",
