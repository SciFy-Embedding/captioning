      "caption": "Figure 3 shows a comparison of the Nb3Sn layer critical current density (J_c) versus magnetic field for wires of different compositions and heat treatment conditions, all measured at 4.2 K. The figure includes data for IO-Hf wires reacted at 705°C for 65 hours, IO-Zr wires at 700°C for 60 hours, a 2019 APC wire at 700°C for 70 hours, and the RRP® for HL-LHC wire. It identifies the maximum J_c values achieved under varying magnetic fields up to 24 T, demonstrating that both the IO-Hf and IO-Zr wires significantly outperform the 2019 APC wire and show comparable performance to the RRP® wire in terms of layer J_c. This underscores the importance of internal oxidation with different elemental combinations for enhancing superconducting properties.",

It includes comparisons among IO-Hf, IO-Zr, APC-2019 wires, and the RRP® wire for the HL-LHC project, with the FCC J_c specification shown for reference. The data highlights that both IO-Hf and IO-Zr wires meet or exceed the FCC J_c specification across the magnetic field range, indicating their improved performance over previous APC designs and suitability for high-field applications.",

The curves include data for IO-Hf wires, IO-Zr wires, the 2019 APC wire, and the RRP® wire for HL-LHC. The figure indicates the normalized resistance as a function of applied magnetic field, showing critical transition regions up to 29 T. The R-B curves are crucial for evaluating the upper critical field (Bc2) and irreversibility field (Birr), revealing that the IO-Zr and IO-Hf wires demonstrate higher Bc2 compared to the 2019 APC and RRP® wires, emphasizing their advanced superconducting capabilities.",
