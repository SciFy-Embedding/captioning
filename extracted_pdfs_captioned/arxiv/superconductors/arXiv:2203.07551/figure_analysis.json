      "caption": "Figure 3 illustrates the temperature dependence of the upper critical field (Hc2) or the irreversibility field (Hirr) for several superconductor candidates, including Bi-2212, Nb-Tin (Nb3Sn), and YBa2Cu3O7−x (YBCO). The axes represent the temperature (T) in Kelvin (K) on the x-axis and the upper critical field or irreversibility field in Tesla (T) on the y-axis. Notable trends include higher Hc2 values for cuprate and iron-based superconductors compared to Nb3Sn. This figure supports the potential of these materials as future accelerator magnets that could offer a higher performance due to their superior Hc2 and Hirr properties compared to conventional superconductors like Nb3Sn. The scientific significance lies in exploring the feasibility of using these materials as high-field superconducting magnets, which could revolutionize accelerator technology by achieving stronger magnetic fields .",

Each curve represents a different heat treatment condition, with peaks correlating to specific phases largely determined by treatment temperatures marked on the right. The observed intensity differences, notably the more prominent peaks at higher temperatures, indicate modifications in phase proportions, with FeAs phase prevalent. This pattern serves as pivotal evidence of the crystallographic evolution in response to varying heat treatment conditions, emphasizing the need for precise thermal control to optimize superconducting phase purity .",

The graph features two distinctive peaks showing the 'Best Jc' and 'Worst Jc', highlighting a significant peak shift towards better Jc performance when more optimal heat treatment is applied (600°C followed by 750°C). The findings suggest that optimizing the sequence and conditions of the heat treatments notably enhances the superconducting properties, confirming the sensitivity of Jc to precise thermal management in K-doped Ba122 superconductors .",
