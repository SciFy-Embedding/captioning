      "caption": "This figure illustrates the surface resistance of Nb3Sn as a function of temperature (T). The black squares represent the BCS surface resistance calculated using the SRIMP model, while the red line is a fit using the equation Rs(T) = 0.001 * e^(49.452/T). The x-axis shows the temperature (T) in Kelvin, ranging from 2 to 20 K, and the y-axis represents the surface resistance in nano-ohms (nΩ), presented on a logarithmic scale from 10^0 to 10^5 nΩ. This graphical representation helps validate the SRIMP calculations with an explicit fitting function used for simulations. The findings emphasize how closely the model fits the calculated data, providing insights into the thermal management capabilities of Nb3Sn, particularly crucial in superconducting applications where precise predictions of surface resistance are necessary for optimizing performance.",

The x-axis represents the magnetic field (B) in millitesla (mT) ranging from 50 to 350 mT, while the y-axis shows the critical thickness (d) in micrometers (μm) on a logarithmic scale from 10^0 to 10^4 μm. Different colored markers indicate assumptions of residual resistance values: 1000 nΩ (blue), 100 nΩ (green), 10 nΩ (red), and 1 nΩ (purple). The findings demonstrate that an increase in residual surface resistance leads to a substantial decrease in critical thickness. This phenomenon points to the significant impact of surface resistance on the onset of thermal instabilities in Nb3Sn films, underlining the necessity to manage surface resistance to prevent thermal runaway in superconductor applications.",

The data points for each temperature are highlighted in different colors: 2K (cyan), 4K (red), and 6K (blue).

It emphasizes the progressive increase in thickness of the Nb3Sn RF layer and illustrates the point at which global thermal runaway occurs—termed as the 'critical thickness.' Denoted in a hypothetical superconductor with an inner RF surface experiencing 50 mT, 1.3 GHz RF field, this setup uses a liquid helium bath for cooling. This model links the concept of thermal management with material thickness, highlighting critical parameters for avoiding thermal instability in superconductors.",

Conductivities are varied by a factor of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3, represented in different marker colors: + (red), ∘ (green), ✕ (blue). The results establish that thermal conductivity significantly influences the critical thickness; enhanced thermal conductivity increases the thickness tolerance up to which thermal stability is maintained.
