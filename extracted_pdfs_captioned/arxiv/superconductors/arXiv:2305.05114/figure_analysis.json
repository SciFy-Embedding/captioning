The high intensity of the Sn 3d peak versus the Nb and O peaks indicates a high Sn presence relative to Nb and O at this subsurface location. These spectra illustrate the chemical state of surface elements and are used to study thermodynamic routes involving SnOx in the nucleation of Nb3Sn alloys, where SnOx plays a critical role under these conditions .",

Data is segmented into different surface treatments: clean Nb, native oxidized, and anodized. As-deposited samples show initial Sn and Nb presence with noticeable NbClx and NbxSny formation, while the absence of Cl in annealed samples signifies transformation into Sn oxides. The profiles detail how oxidation affects the chemical state transition from SnCl2 to SnOx and NbxSny alloy nucleation .",
