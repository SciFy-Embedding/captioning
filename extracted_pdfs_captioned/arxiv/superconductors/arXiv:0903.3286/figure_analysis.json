      "caption": "This figure displays a series of STM images taken at various voltages (-1500 mV to 1500 mV) at a temperature of 7.3 K on the reconstructed V3Si(001) surface, highlighting voltage-dependent changes in line profiles. The top row portrays the STM images, where structural features become distinct at low voltages, indicative of localized electronic states around the Fermi level. The bottom panels show cross-sectional height profiles at select locations, using dashed and solid lines in the corresponding images, illustrating the voltage-dependent topography changes. This visualization supports research into atomically resolved surface reconstructions induced by impurities such as carbon, contributing critical insights into electronic structures relevant to surface states .",

The data points are represented as dots, while solid lines depict fit curves for each conductance, showing good agreement with experimental results. The spectra are normalized to the conductance value at -14 mV, and the spectra shifts demonstrate changes in the energy gap behavior, providing evidence of Andreev reflections at the normal-metal/superconductor interface. The variations represent differential changes in energy gap properties as junction conductance increases, thereby reflecting physical interactions governed by superconducting properties of the material .",
