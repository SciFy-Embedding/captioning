      "caption": "Figure 3 presents the raw data of inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) measurements at varied temperatures (300 K, 30 K, and 4 K), highlighting the temperature-dependent behavior of the soft phonon mode at Q = (3.85, 0.15, 0). The panel (a) depicts the phonon intensity evolution across temperatures with black dots, blue circles, and squares representing different temperature datasets. The lines overlaying the data correspond to fits using a damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) function for phonon peaks, adjusted for experimental resolution, and a pseudo-Voigt function for the elastic line. Panel (b) illustrates the temperature-dependent phonon energy (blue dots) and linewidth (red circles), highlighting significant phonon renormalization upon cooling. This data is critical for understanding the coupling between electron and phonon states and reflects on the structural changes preceding the superconducting phase transition.",

Panels (a) to (d) show calculated phonon dispersion lines against experimental phonon energies reflected by squares, with vertical bars denoting the electronic contributions to phonon linewidths. Panel (e) provides a comparative view of the phonon density of states, highlighting partial contributions from different atomic motions and matching with experimental neutron scattering results. The final panel (f) depicts the calculated Eliashberg function and the electron-phonon coupling constant, offering insights into the role of phonons in electronic properties and superconductivity .",

The raw IXS data (panel a) at T = 20 K and 4 K illustrates how phonon coupling is affected below the superconducting transition temperature T<sub>c</sub>. The blue line demonstrates a fit using DHO functions while the analysis accounts for elastic contributions with experimental backgrounds. Panel (b) compares theoretical predictions for the phonon lineshape at different values of the superconducting energy gap. This analysis is crucial for validating theoretical models of electron-phonon interactions in superconductors.",
