      "caption": "Figure 6 presents the estimated excess tin on the cavity surface over time during the Nb3Sn coating process. The x-axis represents time in hours, while the y-axis shows the excess tin in arbitrary units. The figure illustrates distinct phases: nucleation, temperature ramp with rapid growth, slower growth, and annealing. Initially, excess tin increases, associated with the nucleation stage and early rapid growth as temperature ramps, followed by a decline as the coating process progresses and ends with an annealing phase. The variation indicates the complex dynamics of the tin supply and consumption in Nb3Sn growth, significant for achieving desired stoichiometry in superconducting applications .",

The x-axis represents energy in millielectronvolts (meV), and the y-axis depicts the phonon density of states, specifically the electron-phonon coupling function α²F(ω). The plot shows that as the tin content increases beyond the 25% stoichiometry, the overall value of α²F(ω) decreases, suggesting a reduced electron-phonon interaction strength with higher tin content. This trend illustrates the complex interplay between electron-phonon interactions and stoichiometry, influencing superconducting properties such as the critical temperature (T_c)【8:5†file】.",
