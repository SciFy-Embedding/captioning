      "caption": "Figure 18 depicts the cable temperature evolution along the cooling length as a function of time for the A1 channel. The y-axis represents the temperature in Kelvin (K), while the x-axis displays the position along the cooling length in meters (m). The curves represent different times after the cooling starts, indicated by different marker styles and colors for each time instance, ranging from 2 to 9 seconds. The figure illustrates the temperature distribution of the cable, showing a peak temperature over time along the different sections of the cable. Key findings show that the temperature decreases as the cooling progresses, and the cable's hottest section gradually shifts position. This trend highlights the efficiency of the cooling system in reducing the cable temperature along its length over time.",
