      "caption": "Figure 12 presents a schematic diagram divided into two parts: (a) the z-plane and (b) the w-plane, representing the contour transformation pertinent in the analysis of superconductor groove dynamics. In (a), the diagram highlights the geometry of a groove, with angles and regions clearly marked to showcase the distinction between magnetic field application areas and superconductive surfaces. The direction of the applied current Jâ‚€ is indicated along the positive x-axis. The transformation to the w-plane in (b) reveals the similar layout, key to understanding the conformal mapping whereby points A, B, and C in the z-plane are transformed to points A', B', and C' in the w-plane. The figure elucidates the translation of vortices within superconductors when experiencing external magnetic fields. The scientific significance lies in its application to evaluating vortex-penetration fields at grooves with depth shallower than the penetration depth in extreme type II superconductors, a crucial component for enhancing the performance of superconducting cavities in high-energy accelerators.",
