The x and y axes in (a) represent the position along the beamline in meters and the envelope size in millimeters, respectively. The primary beam loss occurs within the beampipe between the cryomodule input port and the cavity flange, as evidenced by the peaked distribution in (b), which plots position against normalized particle density. This visualization highlights the critical points of energy loss within the system, important for optimizing accelerator design.",
