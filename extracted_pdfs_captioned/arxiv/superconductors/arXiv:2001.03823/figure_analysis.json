      "caption": "Figure 6 illustrates the performance of multicell cavities coated with Nb3Sn. The graphs display the intrinsic quality factor (Q0) against the accelerating gradient (Eacc) for two coated cavities, 5C75-RI-NbSn2, tested at 4.4 K and 2.0 K on different dates. The data reveals a significant enhancement in quality factor compared to typical uncoated niobium cavities, achieving Q0 values close to 10^10 at 4 K, which is approximately a 30-fold improvement. This marked improvement in RF performance is significant, demonstrating the potential of Nb3Sn-coated cavities for applications in superconducting radiofrequency accelerators, providing higher efficiency and lower energy losses.",
