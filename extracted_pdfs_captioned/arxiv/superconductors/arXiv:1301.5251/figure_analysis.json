      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates the T_c distribution and its evolution under different temperatures and magnetic fields, focusing on wires reacted at 625°C for 320 hours and 675°C for 84 hours. The T_c distribution in panel (a) for a wire at 625°C exhibits two distinct peaks for large and fine grains, with fits indicating their individual contributions. The data suggest significant overlap in the temperature ranges of the grain families, especially under elevated magnetic fields. The shift of the peaks towards lower temperatures under increasing fields is indicative of varying B_c^2 among different grain sizes, with larger grains typically showing lower B_c^2 values due to higher atomic ordering influenced by Sn content.",

Parts (a) and (b) show distinct T_c peaks for the wire treated at lower temperatures, corresponding to fine and large grain A15 phases. The magnetization versus temperature curves in (c) and (d) highlight double transitions, reinforcing the separate contributions from different grain morphologies. This experimental setup emphasizes the correlation between heat treatment, T_c distribution, and B_c^2 values of different grain structures.",

The data captured at magnetic fields of 1T and 3T illustrate the merging of peaks under increased field strength, demonstrating the differing B_c^2 values for each grain type. The observations underscore the influence of Sn content and atomic ordering on superconducting properties, critical for optimizing superconducting performance in these materials.",
