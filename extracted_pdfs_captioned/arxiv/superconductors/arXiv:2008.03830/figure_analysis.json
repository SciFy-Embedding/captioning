      "caption": "Figure 4 shows the frequency of element usage in bcc HEA superconductors, as depicted on a periodic table. This visualization highlights the predominant selection of elements such as Hf, Zr, Ti, Ta, Nb, and V, revealing that HEAs with a VEC around 4 to 5 are preferred due to their compliance with the Matthias rule. The chart distinctly illustrates that a majority of the frequently used elements belong to the second and third transition series, contributing to the optimal VEC range and enhancing superconducting properties. The scientific significance lies in guiding the selection of elemental compositions for designing effective bcc HEA superconductors, emphasizing the role of these specific elements in achieving desired properties.",

Part (b) illustrates the *δ* and VEC dependence of *T*c for these superconductors. The data indicate that most HEAs exhibit enhanced *T*c at a lower VEC of around 7. The plots reveal that, while *T*c enhances with decreasing VEC, it remains lower than those of both crystalline and amorphous superconductors. This analysis underscores the complexity and challenge of optimizing superconducting properties in hcp-related HEAs, where minor phases may emerge below a VEC of 7, and emphasizes the necessity for wide-ranging VEC studies in hcp phase research.",
