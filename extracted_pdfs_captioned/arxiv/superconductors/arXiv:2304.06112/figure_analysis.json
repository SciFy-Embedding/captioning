      "caption": "Figure 4. XPS Nb 3d curve-fitting: progressive evolution of the surface oxide layer in Nb3Sn-coated SRF grade Nb, upon heating from 325 ºC to high temperature (~700 ºC). This figure presents the evolution of the surface oxide composition on Nb3Sn as a function of temperature. The binding energy axis shows the evolution in electron volts (eV), while the intensity axis provides normalized values for spectral intensity. The data suggest the reduction of Nb5+ oxides, indicated by the decrease in peaks for Nb2O5 and Nb2O5- phases as temperature increases, indicative of progressive dissolutions. The scientific significance lies in understanding the thermal stability and transformation of the surface oxide layer on Nb3Sn, which is critical for enhancing the performance of Nb3Sn superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities, crucial for quantum computing and particle accelerator applications.",

Chemical shift observed in the a) Nb 3d XPS spectra recorded from pure-Nb and Nb3Sn, b) Sn 3d XPS spectra, and d) Sn MNN Auger lines. c) represents the dependency of binding energy with respect to electronic density and electronegativity differences in Nb3Sn. This figure compares the electronic structural differences between pure niobium and Nb3Sn. The panels illustrate how electron density and electronegativity influence the chemical environment of niobium and tin atoms, showing shifts in binding energies due to these factors. It is evident that the interaction in Nb3Sn modifies the electron density around Nb atoms compared to pure Nb, providing insights into the oxide layer's thickness, composition, and heating behavior. Understanding these shifts is critical for optimizing Nb3Sn for SRF cavities and other high-performance applications.",
