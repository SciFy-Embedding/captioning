      "caption": "This figure shows the coil stress distribution at three different states: room temperature, operating at 4.5 K with zero magnetic field, and at the nominal 10 T magnetic field. The stress is mapped using a color gradient indicating different stress levels, with the highest stress observed at room temperature. These distributions highlight that horizontal pre-stress is critical for maintaining coil integrity up to the operating field, managing the Lorentz forces effectively and ensuring structural contact, which is vital for the reliable operation of the Nb3Sn superconducting dipole magnets designed for the Muon Collider Storage Ring. The stress concentration zones, especially in the coil corners, are within acceptable limits, indicating robust mechanical design that supports high-field operations【4:2†temp_paper_5df9ee995da428412d6c44f51880d786.txt】.",

The use of ANSYS for stress analysis ensures an accurate depiction of mechanical stresses that inform the optimization of coil geometry and pre-stress conditions. This stress management is crucial for operating at high magnetic fields while minimizing risks of deformation or quenching, which is critical for the muon collider's high-field requirements【4:1†temp_paper_5df9ee995da428412d6c44f51880d786.txt】.",
