The x-axis represents the distance across the grains in nanometers (nm), and the y-axis denotes the concentration in atomic percentage (at.%) for Nb and Sn. There is a distinct segregation of Sn at the grain boundary, reaching a maximum concentration of approximately 33 at.% with a segregation width of around 3 nm. This segregation is significant as it affects the superconducting properties of the material, influencing the performance and efficiency of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities by promoting vortex nucleation, which impairs the cavity quality factor.",

The blue curve demonstrates a growing activation of surface grain boundaries correlating with the decline in Q depicted by the yellow curve, illustrating Q dropping from 10^10 to 10^9 as Brf increases from 22 mT to 66 mT. This model suggests that only a minuscule percentage (~0.03%) of grain boundaries need be activated to effect a significant Q degradation at the sulfur-RF conditions common to Nb3Sn cavities.",

The profiles reveal that temperatures near active grain boundaries can rise up to approximately 10K, significantly affecting the superconducting properties by localizing heating effects due to grain boundary activation at fields of B = 60mT. The spatial decay of temperature underscores the heating influence as being constrained primarily to the grain boundaries.
