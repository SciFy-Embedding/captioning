      "caption": "Figure 3 illustrates a detailed schematic representation of the experimental setup used for synthesizing composite long-length superconducting tape on the basis of Nb3Sn. The side view of the setup includes components such as: 1) the cover of the top chamber, 2) direction guider for descending and lifting quartz shoot with roll, 3) quartz shoot with quartz horn, 4) top part of the operating chamber, 5) loading bobbin with a pure Niobium ribbon, 6) receiving bobbin for Tin plated Nb3Sn tape, and other essential components like rolls, screens, and vacuum pumps. This configuration is crucial for achieving the desired homogeneity and thickness of the Nb3Sn layer, while minimizing thermal losses and ensuring vacuum conditions conducive to high Jc characteristics. The setup design is integral to advancing the thermodiffusion synthesis process necessary for creating high-performance superconducting tapes used in applications demanding high magnetic fields .",

      "caption": "Figure 6 presents the top view schematic of the experimental setup for coating Nb3Sn. Key components include: 1) speed reducer, 2) electrical motor, 3) speed reducer's axle, 4) circuit activating drawing mechanism, 5) bobbin to accumulate plated tape, 6) sighting window, among others. This view focuses on the operational dynamics, particularly how the plated tape is managed through a series of rolls, guided by a speed-reducing mechanism, ensuring uniform application and precise control over the process. This configuration is essential for efficient thermo-diffusion processing and is critical for achieving uniform critical current densities across the superconducting tape.",

      "caption": "Figure 12 shows the graph illustrating the dependence of the critical current (Jc) on the temperature (T, 째C) of the Tin melt, focusing on two conditions: 1) the initial Tin plated Nb ribbon with Nb3Sn layer, and 2) after thermal treatment. The critical current measurements at T=4.2 K in a 6 Tesla magnetic field indicate that optimal plating temperatures range from 900째C to 920째C. The graph demonstrates how post-treatment processes at 905째C for 20 hours improve the critical current capacity, highlighting the importance of temperature management in enhancing the superconducting properties of Nb3Sn tapes. This finding is crucial for optimizing the synthesis process to achieve high-performance superconducting materials.",
