      "caption": "The figure displays a graph illustrating the correlation between the critical temperature (T_c) in Kelvin and the resistance ratio (ρ(300K)/ρ(25K)) for superconducting Nb-Ge films. The x-axis represents the resistance ratio, ranging from 1 to 3, while the y-axis denotes the critical temperature (T_c) ranging from 0 to 24 Kelvin. This plot is derived from experimental data collected on thin films with varying sputtering conditions, compositions, and thicknesses. The data points show a marked upward trend, indicating that an increase in the resistance ratio correlates with an increase in the critical temperature. The solid line represents the theoretical fit based on weak localization and phonon-mediated interaction models. This study signifies the universal correlation between the resistance ratio and T_c in Nb-Ge films, pointing towards a fundamental behavioral trait in superconductors subjected to disorder, irrespective of the method used to introduce the disorder.",

      "caption": "This figure presents a comparative analysis of the dependence of critical temperature (T_c) on residual resistivity (ρ_0 at 22°C) for Nb3Sn and Nb3Ge. The x-axis denotes the residual resistivity in micro-ohm-centimeters, spanning from 0 to 100, while the y-axis represents the critical temperature, from 0 to 28 K. Two sets of data are plotted: one for Nb3Sn (solid circles) and another for Nb3Ge (open circles). Theoretical models are plotted as solid curves. Notably, the T_c for Nb3Sn shows declining trends with increasing resistivity, mirroring results for Nb3Ge, albeit with shifted curves reflecting material-specific properties. These results depict the significant impact of disorder (captured by increased resistivity) on T_c, reinforcing the concept of weak localization effects where scattering decreases T_c by affecting electron-phonon interactions. This graph thus underscores the universality of the residual resistivity impact across different superconducting materials.",
