      "caption": "Figure 1 displays the temperature-dependent terahertz (THz) probe transmitted field (Eprobe) and conductivity characteristics in Nb3Sn, showcasing the superconducting (SC) gap. (a) Illustrates the THz field as a function of gate delay time from 4K to 20K, demonstrating the thermal equilibrium phase. (b) and (c) display the temperature dependence of the imaginary (σ2(ω)) and real parts (σ1(ω)) of the conductivity as measured by THz spectroscopy. The inset in (c) schematically represents Cooper pair breaking, a fundamental process in superconducting research. (d) and (e) show mass renormalization (m*/m) and momentum scattering rate (1/τ), derived from the conductivities shown in (b) and (c). The data underscore the behavior of the superconducting gap (2∆SC) which is noted at 4.1K as a grey solid line, and the asymptotic behavior of m*/m and 1/τ as ω approaches zero frequency. This figure supports understanding of superconducting electrodynamics and aids in identifying changes in electron-phonon interactions across the SC transition.",

      "caption": "Figure 2 illustrates non-equilibrium terahertz conductivity in Nb3Sn under influence of various pump fluences. (a) and (b) show σ1(ω) and σ2(ω) at a pump-probe delay of 10 ps, detailing the transformation at fluences ranging from 0.05 to 16 µJ/cm². The inset in (b) provides the effective temperature T* at different fluences. (c) and (d) illustrate the fluence dependence of superfluid density (ns) and the SC gap (∆SC). The results signify the impact of optical excitations on the superconducting state, elucidating the fluence-dependent energy transfer processes and defining how electronic states reconfigure dynamically in response to energy input.",

(a) Displays the experimental (dots) and model-fitted pump-probe dynamics (black line). (b) and (c) depict fluence-dependence of model parameters K and τ/β, respectively, with the corresponding fitting curve in red. In (d), the mean square error (MSE) of fitting versus quasi-particle (QP) energy absorption fraction (p) is shown, with the inset highlighting the fitting saturation of pump induced ∆E. This thorough analysis quantifies the quantum transfer limit of energy, fostering an understanding of electron-phonon interactions within the ultrafast timescale.",

In (b), the ∆Eprobe's temperature dependence is examined, showcasing the persistence of photo-induced signals above T_c and revealing a higher transition temperature T_M linked with Martensitic instabilities. (c) Shows the low-frequency conductivity, σ1(ω), post-photoexcitation, contrasting equilibrium and excited states. These findings illustrate the ultrafast dynamic interplay between optical phonon modes and electron correlations, underpinning the Martensitic influence above SC transition.",
