      "caption": "Tomographic cross sections of Bi-2212 wire acquired after in situ heat treatment to (a) Tmax=875 °C and (b) Tmax=915 °C. This figure shows the impact of complete melting of the Bi-2212 phase on filament connectivity. At 875 °C, filamentary structures remain interrupted by lens-shaped voids, whereas at 915 °C a more continuous structure is observed due to full melting and recrystallization of Bi-2212, enhancing filament connectivity. The insets provide 3D reconstructed images of selected filaments, illustrating how complete melting at higher temperatures resolves void structure issues, contributing to better electrical performance and highlighting the critical temperature threshold for optimal superconducting wire processing.",
