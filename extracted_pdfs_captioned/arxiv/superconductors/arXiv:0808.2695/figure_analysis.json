      "caption": "This figure displays the temperature dependence of resistivity for the undoped, nonsuperconducting PrFeAsO sample. The resistivity shows a power-law behavior below 155 K, associated with a structural phase transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic. Above 250 K, resistivity linearly increases with temperature, lacking the saturation-like behavior typically observed in good metals. The different behavior compared to superconducting samples indicates distinct electronic interactions and absence of superconductivity, highlighting the role of doping in inducing superconductivity. This underscores the influence of structural transitions and electronic correlations in the parent compound's resistive properties.",

      "caption": "This figure illustrates the temperature dependence of resistivity for two fluorine-doped superconducting PrFeAsO samples: PrFeAsO<sub>0.6</sub>F<sub>0.12</sub> (S1) and PrFeAsO<sub>0.7</sub>F<sub>0.12</sub> (S2). Panel (a) shows the resistivity (ρ) decreasing rapidly with temperature until reaching the superconducting transition temperature (T<sub>c</sub>), where it drops sharply to nearly zero around 47 K. The inset provides an enlarged view of the resistivity change for sample S1, highlighting the transition. Panel (b) represents the derivative of resistivity with respect to temperature (dρ/dT) for PrFeAsO<sub>0.6</sub>F<sub>0.12</sub>, which emphasizes the change near the superconducting transition. These measurements are significant as they elucidate the electronic transport characteristics and confirm the critical temperatures associated with superconductivity, indicating strong electron-phonon interactions.",

      "caption": "The figure presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern for the superconducting PrFeAsO<sub>0.6</sub>F<sub>0.12</sub> sample at room temperature. The solid line corresponds to the Rietveld refinement of the diffraction pattern using the P4/nmm space group. This analysis revealed lattice parameters a = 3.9711 Å and c = 8.5815 Å, indicating the tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type structure. The absence of impurity phases and the precise fitting of the data demonstrate the sample's purity and structural integrity, crucial for investigating its superconducting properties. The scientific significance lies in confirming the structural characteristics that contribute to the material's superconducting behavior.",
