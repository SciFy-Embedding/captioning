      "caption": "Figure 2 illustrates the triangular groove geometry used in the superheating field suppression (SFS) model, highlighting the influential parameters in the model, namely the slope angle (θ) and depth (δ) of grooves. Panel (a) shows the schematic of the groove geometry. In panel (b), a color plot of the SFS factor, η, as a function of δ and θ conforms to Equation [6] in the text. Panel (c) presents the η(θ) relationship in the deep-groove limit, using coherence length (ξ = 3 nm) and London penetration depth (λ = 120 nm), values characteristic of Nb3Sn. These results indicate that even minor topographical defects can severely degrade the SFS factor, particularly under conditions of grooves a few tens of nanometers deep and slope angles exceeding 10°. This degradation implies a potential reduction in the superheating field critical to maintaining superconductivity under applied magnetic fields, a pertinent concern in the design of superconducting cavities and materials【4:3†temp_paper_d7a7642f857a4639f8207526e066fb8b.txt】.",

      "caption": "Figure 5 depicts the distribution and relative frequency of various topographic parameters and factors affecting the superheating field suppression and magnetic field enhancement in Nb3Sn samples. Panel (a) displays the distribution of local slope angles (θ), while panel (b) presents deviations (δ) from a background plane, associated with the depth of topographic grooves. Panel (c) shows local magnetic field enhancement (MFE) factors (β), and panel (d) depicts local superheating field suppression (SFS) factors (η), revealing a bifurcation process as the coating duration increases. Panel (e) focuses on the low-η SFS factors, illustrating the influence of deepening thermal grooves over time. The analysis suggests no discernible evolution of θ with coating time, while δ depth increases, consistent with thermal grooving mechanisms. SFS factors show stabilization in the deep-groove limit despite groove deepening, critical for applications requiring consistent superheating fields【4:10†temp_paper_d7a7642f857a4639f8207526e066fb8b.txt】.",

      "caption": "Figure 3 provides TMAFM images and corresponding slope angle maps of Nb3Sn surfaces, illustrating topographical changes with different coating durations. Top rows show the rough surface topographies at various durations visually, and the bottom rows quantitatively present the angle of slopes using color coding. The figure suggests that as coating duration increases, larger grain sizes and elevated slope angles, which can locally exceed 60°, develop. Such changes in topography influence magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression, with taller grains producing higher slope angles, hence possibly more severe impacts on the superconducting properties due to increased surface defects【4:3†temp_paper_d7a7642f857a4639f8207526e066fb8b.txt】.",

Panels (b) and (c) respectively depict maps of magnetic field enhancement (MFE) and superheating field suppression (SFS) factors calculated from this topography. Regions where SFS and MFE coincide are circled, highlighting potential areas of significant performance degradation. The coverage implies that these coinciding regions might lead to substantial declines in superconductor performance by reducing the peak accelerating field, demonstrated by common high-angle grain boundaries【4:9†temp_paper_d7a7642f857a4639f8207526e066fb8b.txt】.",
