      "caption": "This figure presents selected area electron diffraction patterns from the 101 and 211 zone axes. The upper panels show diffraction patterns with primary diffraction arcs centered around the direct beam, indicated by solid lines in the schematic sketches below, representing diffraction from graphite. The surrounding dashed arcs indicate double diffraction around MgCNi3 spots. These patterns reveal the textured relationship between graphite and the MgCNi3 lattice, with graphite nanoparticles visualized as having sizes between 2-5 nm【4:4†temp_paper_5a449345ef59376951ad18b3dda57e79.txt】.",

The inset provides a high-resolution image of the moiré fringe spacing relative to atomic rows of the MgCNi3 phase, indicating a lattice fringe separation spanning about five MgCNi3 unit cells. This figure supports the study on the size of nanoprecipitates (2-5 nm) and the cube-on-cube texture with the MgCNi3 matrix, highlighting the significance of moiré fringes in examining nanoprecipitate size and mismatches【4:1†temp_paper_5a449345ef59376951ad18b3dda57e79.txt】.",

The sketches indicate primary spots, cubic precipitate spots, and double diffraction spots, which result from primary MgCNi3 beams doubling as incident beams for the precipitate. This figure underscores the presence of additional cubic precipitate spots following the matrix's cubic symmetry and contributes to understanding precipitate-induced strain【4:6†temp_paper_5a449345ef59376951ad18b3dda57e79.txt】.",
