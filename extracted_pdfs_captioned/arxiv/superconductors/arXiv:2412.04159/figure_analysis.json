      "caption": "Figure 8 shows the DC magnetic moment curves as a function of the applied external field (Hext) for temperatures ranging 3–15 K, with plots for both Sample A (a) and Sample B (b). These curves illustrate significant findings, such as the lower critical field (Bc1) for Sample A, which is distinctly characterized below the transition temperature (Tc). Both samples demonstrate irreversible magnetization hysteresis below their respective Tc, a behavior typical of type-II superconductors. Insets provide virgin magnetic moment curves at 3 K, highlighting critical transitions near Bc1. These observations reveal Sample A's higher superconducting volume fraction compared to Sample B, which is confirmed through corresponding reflectometry data and cross-sectional TEM analyses.",

Each graph presents data obtained while warming samples zero-field-cooled to 3 K, showing Tc(onset) around 13 K. The curves highlight essential thermal and field-dependent behavior of the superconducting state, emphasizing differences in pinning efficiency, as inferred from magnetization behaviors such as the Paramagnetic Meissner Effect and other reversible phenomena.",

The patterns reveal differences in V3Si peak intensity and presence of oxide phases, with a noticeable reduction in these peaks for Sample B due to the complete consumption of the SiO2 layer. This phase transformation and consumption of SiO2 indicate significant restructuring, a critical insight into the thermal treatment effects and V-Si reactions.",
