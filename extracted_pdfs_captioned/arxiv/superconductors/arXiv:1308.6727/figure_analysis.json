      "caption": "Figure 4 depicts the increase of pulse length with major radius and aspect ratio in a tokamak design for a Demonstration Power Plant (DEMO). The plot graphs the dependency of pulse length on the physical dimensions of the device, which is a critical factor for optimizing the reactor's design to achieve prolonged operational periods without compromising performance. This figure is significant as it illustrates the reactorâ€™s manipulation capability to increase pulse duration as a function of the major radius, leveraging a larger plasma volume for efficiency. This insight aids in understanding design constraints and performance expectations of DEMO reactors .",
