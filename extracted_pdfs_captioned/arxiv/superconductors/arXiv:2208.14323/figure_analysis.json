      "caption": "The figure illustrates the critical engineering current density (Je in A/mmÂ²) plotted against the magnetic field (Field in T) for three superconducting materials: Nb3Sn at 1.9 K, Bi2212 at 4.2 K, and REBCO (CORC/STAR) at 4.2 K. The data is presented with different line styles for each material: dashed blue line for Nb3Sn, solid black line for Bi2212, and dash-dotted black line for REBCO. The decreasing trend of Nb3Sn's Je with increasing field highlights its superior high-field performance compared to Bi2212 and REBCO at higher field strengths. This information is significant in selecting superconducting materials for applications in high-field environments, providing insight into the operational limitations and effectiveness of these superconductors.",

The Stress Management Cos-theta (SMCT) design also includes 4 (top) and 2 (bottom) Bi2212 layers. The Canted Cos-theta (CCT) configuration utilizes 4 layer Bi2212 coils. The Block (BL) design is presented with and without stress management features, and the Common Coil (CC) design incorporates Bi2212 in combination with 3 (top) and 5 (center) external Nb3Sn layers, as well as REBCO CORC with 4 external Nb3Sn layers (bottom). These designs reflect innovative strategies in superconducting magnet structures, essential for optimally distributing the fields and managing mechanical stresses.",

Case I (top) applies the same engineering current density (Je) to both the insert and outsert coils, whereas Case II (bottom) reduces the Je in the outsert by 33% compared to the insert. Both configurations aim to achieve a 20 T bore field. This analysis demonstrates the potential to balance coil dimensions and material utilization in achieving high magnetic fields, an important consideration for efficient and cost-effective magnet design.",
