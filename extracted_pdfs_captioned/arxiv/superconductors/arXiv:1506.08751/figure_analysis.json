      "caption": "The figure depicts the real part of the optical conductivity (4πReσ(ω)/ω_p²) versus frequency (ω) in meV, scaled by a factor of 10⁴, for a superconducting material at T = 0.1Tc. Two curves illustrate the optical conductivity under normal (red curve) and superconducting (blue curve) states. The plasma frequency (ωp) is noted, and the α²F(ω) spectral function from another referenced figure is shifted rightward along the frequency axis by 2∆0. This figure reveals distinct characteristics of the superconducting gap and highlights transition distinctions in optical response between the normal and superconducting states, reflecting interactions in the superconductor's electron-phonon spectra.",
