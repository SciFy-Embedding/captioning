      "caption": "This figure illustrates the superfluid density as a function of reduced temperature (left panel) and the reduced lower critical field as a function of temperature (right panel) for V3Si. Open circles represent experimental results obtained via reversible magnetization, comparing favorably with single-band BCS theory indicated by the solid line. The broken and dot-dashed lines depict two-band-like superfluid densities from literature, while full diamonds show the two-band behavior of MgB₂. The reduced lower critical field in the right panel mirrors the behavior of the superfluid density, demonstrating congruence with the derived values from experiments and fitting data, reinforcing the single-band behavior of V3Si.",

      "caption": "The figure shows reversible magnetization of MgB₂ as a function of magnetic induction at varying orientations: parallel (H // c) and perpendicular (H // ab) to the sample axis at temperatures of 10, 20, and 30 K. Open circles denote experimental data, while solid lines correspond to fits based on the single-band Ginzburg-Landau model across the entire field range. Broken lines represent fits to specific field parts, indicating MgB₂'s characteristic two-band nature. Discrepancies arise in high-field fits, reflecting smaller lower critical fields than experiment.",

Experimental data from a rotating sample magnetometer (open circles) and SQUID measurements (full circles) both conform closely to the clean-limit BCS behavior depicted by the solid line, predicting an upper critical field of 22.7 T at 0 K. The Ginzburg-Landau parameter shows a linear decrease from approximately 24 to 19 with increasing temperature, in line with single-band BCS expectations.",

      "caption": "This figure displays reversible magnetization of a V3Si single crystal under varying magnetic induction at temperatures of 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, and 5.2 K. Open circles represent experimental data; solid lines represent single-band Ginzburg-Landau model fits. Insets highlight irreversible magnetization at lower fields, emphasizing significant hysteresis. While fits correlate well at higher temperatures (9-15 K), divergence from experimental data increases with decreasing temperature. These observations highlight challenges in fitting lower temperature data within the single-band model.",
