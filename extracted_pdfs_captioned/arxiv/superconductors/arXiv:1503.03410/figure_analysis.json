      "caption": "This figure presents the normalized differential conductance (dI/dV) plotted against the applied voltage (in mV) measured on the surface of an Nb3Sn sample, a key material for superconducting applications. Each curve in the figure is offset vertically for clarity, and the dashed lines indicate the zero conductance for each curve. The tunneling spectra specifically highlight the well-defined superconducting gap present at the Fermi level (V=0 mV), characteristic of the Nb3Sn A-15 phase, important for understanding the quality of superconducting films in RF applications. This setup was intended to discern variations in the superconducting gap and correlate them with potential regions of sub-stoichiometry or defect accumulation, which might lead to localized deterioration of superconductivity. Such data is crucial for improving the RF performance of Nb3Sn-coated Niobium cavities, which are promising candidates for future high-efficiency particle accelerator applications.",

      "caption": "The figure comprises a set of images, including a field of view and Nb-Lα and Sn-Lα X-ray Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (XEDS) elemental maps of an Nb3Sn film grown on a bulk Nb sample. The images focus on the stoichiometric distribution of Nb3Sn (Nb:Sn ≈ 3:1) with elemental maps revealing areas with lower Sn content, specifically regions marked as 1 and 2, indicative of different stoichiometries. The field of view (left) shows the microstructural features while Nb-Lα (center) and Sn-Lα (right) maps display elemental distribution consistent with the phase diagram, highlighting regions of distinct stoichiometry. This microstructure and compositional analysis is pivotal for the optimization of superconducting film coatings, directly impacting the efficiency of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities used in particle accelerators.",

      "caption": "Figure 1 provides a comprehensive structural characterization of the Nb3Sn film produced through the Wuppertal method on a cavity-grade Nb sample. Subfigure (a) presents an SEM image illustrating the grain morphology with a histogram inset showing the grain area distribution centered around 0.6 μm², indicative of an average grain size of approximately 0.9 μm. The X-ray diffraction pattern in subfigure (b) displays the presence of both Nb3Sn and Nb peaks, corresponding with reference data and confirming the polycrystalline nature of the film. Subfigure (c) provides a zoomed-in view revealing peak splitting, which is fitted with Voigt functions, highlighting subtle differences in lattice parameters due to variations in composition within the film. These detailed analyses are essential for understanding the crystalline quality and phase composition, thereby influencing the superconducting properties and performance of Nb3Sn films in SRF applications.",
