      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates the microstructural evolution within Nb3Sn wires post heat-treatment. (a) SEM cross-sectional image reveals the concentric layered structure with components like Cu, Nb, Nb3Sn, and SnO2 distinctly identifiable within a filament. The yellow regions are designated for Atom Probe Tomography (APT) analyses. (b) Higher resolution details of the wire's layered architecture depict interfaces and reaction fronts between layers. HAADF-STEM images (c, d) show rapid growth of Nb3Sn grains at 625°C for 740 hours and 700°C for 120 hours, respectively, with noticeable grain coarsening away from the Nb3Sn/Nb interface. (e) A plot depicting the average grain diameter of Nb3Sn as a function of distance from the interface reaffirms more pronounced grain growth during the higher temperature treatment, emphasizing the impact of heat on grain structure. The figure underscores the crucial role of Zr oxide nanoprecipitates, which act as pinning centers maintaining a coarser grain structure, as corroborated by sections 3.4 and 4 in the study.",

The atomic concentration profiles across these boundaries (e, f) show high concentrations of Zr-O and Nb-O ions, suggesting increased solute segregation at GBs. This segregation, presented through quantitative profiles, lays the groundwork for nucleation of precipitates, and provides critical insights into the pre-reactive state of the Nb alloy.",
