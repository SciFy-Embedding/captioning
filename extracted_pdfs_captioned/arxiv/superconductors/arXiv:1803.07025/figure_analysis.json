      "caption": "Figure 4 highlights the Tc distributions in Nb3Sn superconductors doped with Ta, Ta+Ti, and Ti at both zero and high magnetic fields (15 T), indicated by the fA15 frequency. The x-axis suggests critical temperature (Tc in Kelvin). These distributions are derived from specific heat measurements and are particularly relevant for understanding high-field performance and phase composition uniformity in Nb3Sn wires. Subtle shifts and broadening in Tc distributions hint at the impacts of doping strategies on superconducting phase stability.",

The upward trend reflects how lattice disorder, influenced by dopant site occupancy, significantly impacts superconducting properties like Hc2. Such findings stress the need for optimizing lattice site occupation to gain maximal superconducting performance under high-field conditions, essential for advanced applications.",

The figure shows comparative data for Ti doped #1, Ti+Ta doped, and Ti doped #2 strands. The y-axis represents the EXAFS amplitude, while the x-axis covers radial distances (R in Å) up to 6 Å. For these samples, the spectra primarily indicate that titanium preferentially occupies Nb sites without any notable Ti occupancy at Sn sites. This understanding helps in discerning the microstructural impacts of Ti doping, helping to enhance Nb3Sn's critical current densities by leveraging antisite disorder.",

The subfigures show the amplitude of the EXAFS signal as a function of radial distance (R in Å), comparing Ta doped #1, Ta+Ti doped, and Ta doped #2 Nb3Sn. The presence of peaks at specific R-values suggests significant Ta occupancy on Nb sites with some Ta present on the Sn sites, specifically at about 30% for Ta#1, 32% for the Ta+Ti, and 21% for Ta#2. These sites contribute to variations in the local atomic structure, thereby affecting superconducting properties like Hc2, a crucial factor for optimizing Nb3Sn wire performance for high-field magnet applications.",
