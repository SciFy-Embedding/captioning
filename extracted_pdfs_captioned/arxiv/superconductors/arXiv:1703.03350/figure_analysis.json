      "caption": "Figure 7 illustrates the structural configurations of the C60 molecules and neighboring Cs sites in Cs3C60. Panel (a) depicts the A15 structure, which features 12 tetrahedral Cs sites (shown in magenta) positioned at a distance ζ from the hexagon faces of C60. Panel (b) shows the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, with 8 tetrahedral Cs sites (magenta) at a distance ζ(T) from C60 hexagon centers and 6 octahedral Cs sites (green) at a distance ζ(O) from the C60 6:6 bonds. These configurations are crucial in understanding the differing electronic interactions and disorder levels that influence superconducting properties, emphasizing the role of structural order in determining superconducting transition temperatures. The fcc form is particularly notable for exhibiting merohedral disorder, impacting its superconductivity through increased disorder-induced pair breaking【4:4†temp_paper_0bf00c07110473ae8d472a408e9c0c35.txt】.",

      "caption": "Figure 3 plots the measured optimal transition temperature *T<sub>C</sub>* as a function of the inverse pairing metric (ℓζ)^−1 for A15 Cs2.85(1)C60 and fcc Cs2.901(6)C60, compared to other high-*T<sub>C</sub>* superconductors such as cuprates, iron pnictides, chalcogenides, group-4-metal nitride-chlorides, and RuO- and ET-based compounds. This relationship provides insight into the electronic and structural factors influencing high-temperature superconductivity, highligting the influence of inter-reservoir charge dynamics and site occupancies on superconductive efficiency. The theoretical line for *T<sub>C0</sub>* reflects expectations from the interlayer Coulombic pairing model, indicating disorder in the fcc form reduces its transition temperature below theoretical predictions【4:1†temp_paper_0bf00c07110473ae8d472a408e9c0c35.txt】.",

      "caption": "Figure 5 showcases the dependence of maximum measured transition temperature *T<sub>C</sub>*<sup>max</sup> on Rb content x in the RbxCs3–xC60 series, where open circles represent data points for varying Rb concentrations, and triangles indicate corresponding volume per C60. It reveals a declining trend in *T<sub>C</sub>*<sup>max</sup> with increasing Rb content, suggesting alloying introduces disorder leading to pair-breaking in the superconducting state. These observations reflect the intricate balance between lattice expansion and electronic factors in determining superconducting properties, demonstrating the sensitivity of superconductivity to compositional adjustments and disorder effects in alkali-doped fullerides【4:6†temp_paper_0bf00c07110473ae8d472a408e9c0c35.txt】.",
