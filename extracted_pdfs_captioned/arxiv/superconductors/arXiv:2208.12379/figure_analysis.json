      "caption": "Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between the Residual Resistance Ratio (RRR) and the critical current (Ic) at 15 Tesla and 4.2 Kelvin for RRP strands contributed to the US-based HL-LHC upgrade project. Each point represents a quality control sample with the different shadings indicating various procurement stages throughout the project progression. The vertical and horizontal red lines establish the standards for rolled strand specifications. This study emphasizes that the RRR of rolled strands suitably corresponds with the performance degradation seen in cable extraction tests, signifying the simulation's accuracy. The critical current of these strands demonstrates resilience against rolling or cabling-induced distortions, a key finding for ensuring future high-field magnet capabilities.",

From left to right: a 108/127 RRP strand, a 132/169 RRP strand, and a 192/217 PIT strand, all originating from Bruker. These images serve a quality control function to demonstrate sub-element configuration within the composite superconducting strands. The differences highlight the structural progression from reaction sequences that convert initial filaments into Nb3Sn or other superconducting phases, influencing effective filament diameter and thus minimizing magnetization currents, a critical consideration for minimizing unintended flux shedding and quenching.",
