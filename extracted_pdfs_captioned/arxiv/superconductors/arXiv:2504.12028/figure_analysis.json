      "caption": "Figure 1 presents the magnetic field intensity (in the top section) and Lorentz forces (in the bottom section) within the Bi-2212 strands as determined using ANSYS for the heterogeneous model. The color gradient denotes the magnetic field strength, measured in teslas (T), while the superimposed streamline pattern outlines regions of differing field intensity. The plot indicates significant variances in field intensity across the aperture, coils, and iron yoke. The bottom section shows Lorentz forces (in N/m) acting on the strands, demonstrating the forces distributed around the serpentine path of the Bi-2212 conductor. This analysis is pivotal for understanding the mechanical stresses imposed under operational magnetic fields, contributing crucial insight for the improved mechanical performance of superconducting materials in high-field applications .",

The stress distribution, noted for components like mandrel, epoxy insulation, and coil, highlights the mechanical impact during the energization phase (at 4.8 T) using ANSYS simulations. The plot emphasizes disparities between models, with stress peaks notably around PS-Th load steps in het_Bi2O3 and het_Epoxy/Coil series. Such data underline the structural integrity and reliability of HTS dipoles under rigorous operational conditions.",
