      "caption": "X-ray diffraction patterns of a P-doped Ba-122 film on an IBAD-MgO substrate show out-of-plane and in-plane crystal alignments. (a) ω-coupled 2θ scan reveals diffraction peaks from IBAD-MgO substrate, indicating a planarising 2θ of 29° due to high-temperature growth effects. (b) φ scan of the asymmetric 103 diffraction. (c) & (d) Normalized rocking curves of 004 and 200 diffraction reflect the crystallite tilting and twisting, respectively. Notably, the out-of-plane diffraction FWHM is 1.2° (comparable to prior results), while the in-plane reduces to 5.7°, demonstrating improved crystallinity due to elevated growth temperatures.",
