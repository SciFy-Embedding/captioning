      "caption": "Voltage-current (V-I) curves for a magnetic field H = 4.3 T at T = 13.8 K, demonstrating the presence of two distinct phases: the metastable phase (open squares) with higher critical current and the stable phase (solid squares) with lower critical current. The main panel outlines how V-I curves evolve for different temperatures around the peak effect temperature Tp, shown with insets for T = 13.9 K, 14.0 K, and 14.1 K. These measurements reveal the dynamical transition through metastability, indicative of a competition between elasticity and pinning in the vortex matter below Hp. Scientific significance includes insights into Bardeen-Stephen flux flow onset and vortex reordering mechanisms [7†source].",

The diagram identifies critical field lines: Hp indicating the peak effect and Hc2 as the upper critical field, which signifies the onset of superconductivity. Block arrows infer the presence of long-range order against pinning, showcasing a trend of decreased order at elevated temperatures. This visualization highlights the complex interplay between competing forces affecting the Order-Disorder transitions in superconductors [9†source].",

Panel (a) shows the intensity of the principal Bragg spot that indicates vortex lattice order during cooling (circles) and subsequent warming (squares), highlighting a decrease in intensity as temperature approaches the peak effect at 13 K, suggesting a loss of lattice order. Panel (b) reports the azimuthal and radial peak widths of the Bragg spot intensity, measured as half width at half maximum (HWHM), for both cooling (solid circles) and warming (open circles). These widths reveal significant broadening near the peak effect, indicating increased disorder. The history effects depicted here, with higher intensity and narrower peaks after warming, suggest a 'healing' process in the vortex lattice at low temperatures. These measurements are crucial for understanding the transition from an ordered vortex lattice to a disordered state as temperature approaches the peak-effect regime, providing insight into the elastic-properties-driven order-disorder transformations in vortex physics.",
