      "caption": "The figure plots the voltage-current (V-I) characteristics of a 2 µm-wide Nb3Sn superconducting bridge at different temperatures (2 K to 10 K) under zero external magnetic field (H=0). The x-axis represents the current in milliamperes (mA), and the y-axis represents the voltage in millivolts (mV). Each colored curve corresponds to a different bias temperature as indicated in the legend. The graph shows that at lower temperatures, the V-I curves exhibit multiple resistivity jumps before reaching a steady resistive state. This behavior is indicative of vortex motion within the superconducting material, which contributes to the diode effect observed in the experiment. The varying resistance states suggest that the vortex penetration and motion are temperature-dependent, implying a potential for temperature-tuned superconducting electronics using such micro-bridges.",

      "caption": "This figure depicts the dimensionless voltage variation over time under sinusoidal current bias across a superconducting bridge with external magnetic field values H_ext set at 0.14, 0.16, and 0.20. The x-axis shows time in dimensionless units, while the y-axis shows voltage, also in dimensionless units. The plotted data illustrates the complex interplay between induced current and voltage under different magnetic fields. As the external field increases, the voltage waveform's amplitude and character changes significantly, highlighting the sensitivity of the system to external magnetic modulation. This highlights the potential for tuning diode-like properties in superconducting systems under variable electromagnetic environments.",
