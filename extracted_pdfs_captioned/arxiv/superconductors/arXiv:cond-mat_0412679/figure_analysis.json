The superconducting anomalies split into two peaks, T_c1 = 86 K and T_c2 = 90 K, with an additional two-peak anomaly in the normal state region at T_h1 = 257 K and T_h2 = 269 K. These observations suggest a relation Th/Tc ≈ 3, indicating a possible imprint of the superconducting phase transition onto other temperature regions .",

Measurements reveal an anomaly at approximately the glass transition temperature T_g = 290 K, correlating with the superconducting transition temperature T_c. This Figure supports the hypothesis of a systematic link between anomalies at T_g and T_c across various measurements, underlined by the consistent ratio of 3 (T_g = 3T_c). This finding suggests a fundamental link potentially driven by strong electron-phonon coupling, which alters lattice dynamics in superconductors (R)Ba2Cu3O6+x.",
