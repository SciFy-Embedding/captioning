      "caption": "Figure 4 displays microstructural features of Nb3Sn strands. Panel (a) shows the fracture SEM image of a subelement of EG36-91Re-650x50, highlighting the core and A15 regions. Panel (b) presents the BSE/SEM image of EG36-91Re-650x50 with locations of Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) indicated by white dots for compositional analysis, primarily focused on tin concentration variation. Panel (c) displays the fracture SEM of a subelement in T1489-615x480 revealing the CG (coarse grain) and FG (fine grain) A15 regions. Panel (d) provides Sn concentration profiles across EG36-91Re-650x50 and T1489-615x480h strands. The figures aid in understanding the microstructural composition, particularly focusing on Sn distribution and grain morphology, which are crucial for assessing superconducting properties and the effective area utilization for current carrying in Nb3Sn strands .",

      "caption": "Figure 5 provides a detailed visualization of the fracture surfaces in Nb3Sn strands using SEM imaging. Panel (a) depicts the juxtaposition of the FG and CG areas within T1489-615x480, and (b) focuses on the FG area alone. In contrast, panels (c) and (d) depict the A15 regions of EG36Ti-61Re-650x60 and EG36-91Re-650x50, respectively. These comparisons help elucidate differences in grain structures among strand types, which influence superconducting properties such as critical current density (Jc). Such images reinforce understanding of the microstructural factors affecting strand performance, particularly the distinction between FG and CG areas and how they contribute to the overall Jc .",

Panels (a) and (d) provide BSE images: T1489-615x480 (Tube Type) and HP31-61Re-650x80 (RIT), showing the inclusions and general architecture. Panels (b) and (e) are fracture SEM images focusing on T1505-625x500 and EG36Ti-61Re-650x60 respectively, highlighting variations in core/A15 interfaces. Finally, (c) and (f) zoom further into these interfaces in T1505-625x500 and EG36Ti-61Re-650x60, offering insights into the boundary regions which are significant for current flow. These particulars are critical for understanding how microstructural distinctions affect superconductive behavior in different Nb3Sn strand designs .",

Panels (a), (b), and (c) represent strands T1505, T1628, and T1489 respectively. This data underlines the temperature dependence of transport current densities and the influence of magnetic fields, demonstrating heat treatment as a determining factor for effective superconductive response in these materials. The lower-temperature and extended-duration heat treatments improve strand performance, essential for optimizing industrial applications .",
