      "caption": "The figure presents microcontact spectra of dirty contacts in zero magnetic field. The spectra include four curves depicting different compositions: Curve 1 (Nb3Sn - Nb3Sn, 12 Ω, 4.2 K), Curve 2 (Nb3Sn - Cu, 45 Ω, 4.2 K), Curve 3 (Nb3Sn - Mo, 14 Ω, 5 K), and Curve 4 represents the tunnel function of the electron-phonon interaction (EPI) in Nb3Sn. The x-axis shows energy in mV, likely correlating to phonon frequencies, while the y-axis represents V2 voltage proportional to spectral intensity. Key findings indicate that curve 1 shows significant gap singularity associated with suppressed superconductivity but high reproducibility of phonon singularity positions. This implies the relevance of microcontact spectroscopy in analyzing EPI in superconductors, highlighting the consistency and detection of low-frequency phonon modes that are not prominent in tunnel data, thus providing clearer insight into EPI characteristics of bulk Nb3Sn.",

      "caption": "The figure depicts microcontact spectra (V^2 ∼ d²V/dI²) for pure Nb3Sn-Cu contacts under varying resistances: 41, 388, 62, and 100 Ω, with temperatures ranging from 6.3 to 6.8 K. The inset shows the proposed model of a contact. The x-axis represents energy in meV, while the y-axis indicates the second derivative of the current-voltage characteristic, related to phonon interactions given that energy exceeds the superconducting gap. A consistent spectral band distribution in the range up to 27-30 meV is observed, corresponding with phonon energies, highlighting that the observed peaks primarily arise from the EPI rather than external factors. This detailed spectroscopic analysis is crucial for understanding how stoichiometric deviations and structural imperfections in Nb3Sn impact superconducting properties and electron-phonon interactions.",

The x-axis represents the phonon momentum in reciprocal lattice units (Λ), while the y-axis displays phonon energy in meV. The data were computed as per references cited in the paper. The curves highlight Λ3 and Λ1 phonon modes, showcasing dispersion characteristics critical to understanding Nb3Sn's phononic influence on superconducting properties. These dispersion relations are fundamental in assessing how lattice vibrations correlate with electron-phonon coupling, offering insights into superconducting phase stability and variations in EPI function due to structural anisotropy or stoichiometric imperfections.",
