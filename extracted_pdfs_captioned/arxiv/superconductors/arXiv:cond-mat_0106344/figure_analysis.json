      "caption": "Figure 1: This figure shows the resistivity (ρ) of MgB2 as a function of temperature (T) with the critical transition region detailed in the inset. The axes depict temperature (T) in Kelvin on the x-axis and resistivity (ρ) in micro-ohm centimeters on the y-axis. The inset elucidates the transition region in greater detail. Experimental data are represented by symbols, while the continuous line represents the best fit according to the generalized Bloch-Grüneisen equation, characterized by parameters: residual resistivity (ρ0) = 39.7 μΩ cm, Debye temperature (−R) of 1050 K, and temperature coefficient (−0) = 4.95 x 10^-1 μΩ cm/K. The resistivity decreases sharply near the superconducting transition at T≈38 K, showing typical metallic behavior. This figure is scientifically significant as it demonstrates the superconducting transition and the overall behavior of MgB2's resistivity, validating theoretical models based on electron-phonon coupling.",

      "caption": "Figure 3: This figure illustrates the thermoelectric power (TEP) effectively normalized as S_d/T and S/T against doping in a rigid band scheme as derived from the integrated Density of States (DOS). Subfigure (a) presents the tensor components Sxx/T and Syy/T against dopant concentration (x), with symbols marking the average values across directions. Subfigure (b) compares the average S_d/T of these components to the individual contributions from bands destabilized by doping. Both plots utilize x in a rigid band scheme along the x-axis. The main findings indicate the distinct behavior of bands contributing variably to TEP, influenced by altering electron density through doping. The significant shifts and diverging trends illustrate complex band structure interactions and the role of electron-phonon interactions, pertinent to designing thermoelectric materials.",

      "caption": "Figure 2: This figure shows the Seebeck coefficient (S) of MgB2 as a function of temperature (T), with a detailed analysis of its components within the main plot and inset. The main plot displays temperature (T) in Kelvin on the x-axis and Seebeck coefficient (S) in microvolts per Kelvin on the y-axis. The experimental points are shown along with a continuous line representing the theoretical fit from equation (6) with parameters A = 1.76 x 10^-2 V/K^2 and B = 1.26 x 10^-6 V/K^4. The dashed line indicates the diffusive term, Sd = AT, and the dotted line represents the phonon drag term, derived experimentally as S − Sd. The inset reveals S/T as a function of T^2, fitting well within the range 2000 K² < T² < 8000 K², indicating a predominance of the diffusive over the phonon drag contributions at elevated temperatures. This figure highlights the complex interplay and equal distribution between the diffusive and phonon drag contributions to TEP in MgB2, pivotal for understanding its electronic and thermal properties.",
