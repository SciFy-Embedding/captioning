      "caption": "Figure showing the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for Cr3Ru samples with (a) bcc structure and (b) A15 structure under an applied magnetic field of 40 kOe. The main plot presents the broad temperature-dependent response between 1.8 K and 300 K, showing paramagnetic Curie-Weiss behavior prominently in the low-temperature region. Insets display the susceptibility in zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) modes at 100 Oe, revealing broad hump structures around 150 K likely indicative of antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations. These observations underline the complex magnetic behavior possibly due to AF ordering or spin fluctuations, which contribute to the understanding of the magnetic properties of Cr-Ru binary alloys .",

Insets provide detail on resistance from 0.4 K to 6 K under various magnetic fields, while (c) and (d) present the upper critical field H_c2 as a function of temperature. The superconducting transition is shifted by the presence of a magnetic field, indicating suppression of superconductivity. The figures are fitted with Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory to derive critical parameters. Such insights are essential for characterizing magnetoresistive properties and deducing upper critical field behavior under magnetic conditions for superconductor design .",

A pronounced second peak effect is exclusively observed in bcc structure samples. The insets show the lower critical fields estimated from where M(H) deviates from Meissner state linearity. Panels (c) and (d) explore the field-dependence critical current density calculated using the Bean critical state model, with the inset in (c) focusing on MHLs' second peak. These findings highlight how structural differences affect vortex dynamics and pinning mechanisms, providing insights into superconducting material performance.",
