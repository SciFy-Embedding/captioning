      "caption": "This figure illustrates the quench performance during the first thermal cycle of the LQXFA/B-01 cryo-assembly, which includes MQXFA03 and MQXFA04 magnets. The X-axis represents the ramp number, while the Y-axis shows the current in amperes. The blue dash indicates holding current, red crosses indicate trips, and the green circle represents a quench. The data points marked indicate events such as spontaneous quenches, trips due to cryogenic instability, and test facilities threshold settings, with corresponding time durations noted above each point. The figure is crucial for understanding the stability and performance of the magnet assembly during ramp-up tests, serving as a validation step before acceptance for operational use in the High Luminosity LHC project.",

The cryo-assembly is an essential component containing MQXFA03 and MQXFA04 magnets designed for the HL-LHC upgrade to enhance particle collision experiments. The setup is critical for testing the assembly's performance under controlled conditions and verifying compliance with stringent requirements prior to integration into the HL-LHC.",

The plot, with current ramp number on the X-axis and quench current on the Y-axis in kA, highlights a significant reduction in the number of training quenches achieved by increasing preload stress limits from -110 MPa to -120 MPa. This finding underscores a key methodological improvement that can enhance future magnet performance, crucial for reducing the training period required for HL-LHC accelerator magnets.",
