      "caption": "Figure 5: Time evolution of the beam parameters through the transportation line is shown in three subplots: the left plot depicts the evolution of the rms bunch length (mm) as the beam progresses from the cathode, illustrating the bunch compression; the middle plot shows the rms transverse beam size (mm) also as a function of distance, demonstrating the beam's focusing and defocusing along the path; the right plot presents the total energy (MeV) and energy spread (%), indicating energy gain and spread as the beam accelerates. These visualizations are significant for understanding the impact of cavity focusing and tuning decisions made with quadrupoles and during main acceleration to maintain beam quality and compression during transport.",

The plots use the beam energy in units of the kinetic velocity factor (γβ) against longitudinal position (m). The graphical representation underscores how cavity design affects the beam transport efficiency in non-relativistic conditions. It highlights the broader range of acceptable energy conditions when using β = 0.8 cavities, which is crucial for minimizing energy mismatch losses and improving the overall acceleration process .",
