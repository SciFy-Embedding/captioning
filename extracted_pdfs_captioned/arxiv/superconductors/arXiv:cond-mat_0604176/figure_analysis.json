      "caption": "Figure 3: This figure displays the specific heat C of the superconductor Nb3Sn as a function of magnetic field μ₀H at various temperatures between 11 K and 17.7 K. The main graph shows C increasing sharply near the transition fields, indicating the transition to the normal state, with jumps becoming broader at higher fields. An inset graph compares the superconducting contribution C_SC to the specific heat with the reversible part of the isothermal magnetocaloric coefficient M_T^rev, highlighting the close relationship between these two thermodynamic quantities. The lambda anomaly observed just below the jump at H_c2 suggests the presence of a vortex liquid phase due to thermal fluctuations, emphasizing thermal disorder's role in altering vortex phase stability .",

Vortex shaking, achieved through adding a small AC field, markedly alters the behavior near H_c2 by eliminating the hysteresis loop evident when no shaking is applied, replaced by a pronounced spike reflective of a latent heat signature associated with a first-order vortex melting transition. This observation directly correlates with previously known first-order vortex transitions in other superconductors .",

The graph reveals both reversible and irreversible contributions to M, with distinct peaks (peak effect) occurring as temperatures decrease. At T < 15 K, a hysteresis below H_c2 signifies the peak effect tied to maximum critical current densities J_C. There is symmetry between ascending and descending curves, attributed to thermodynamic and irreversible contributions from vortex pinning and dynamics .",

The AC field markedly changes the coefficient's behavior around H_c2 compared to original non-AC field data, suggesting the presence of a first-order phase transition vortex melting, theorized to create a latent heat spike. These observations imply that while irreversible loops mark peak effects, the reversible characteristic spike indicates thermodynamic origins .",
