      "caption": "Waveform plots of acoustic emissions from sensors A and B during intentional magnet current extraction at 5.5 kA, revealing two different amplitude patterns with distinct frequencies. The y-axis represents voltage (U) in millivolts, indicative of the sound signal strength, and the x-axis represents time in seconds. This figure demonstrates that the magnet acts as a mechanical resonator with a quality factor of approximately 100, as evidenced by the prolonged 'ringing' of sound waves, lasting around 1 second, which is significantly longer than the current transient time constant. The study provides insight into identifying mechanical vibrations and analyzing structural responses within superconducting magnets during high current extractions .",

      "caption": "Summary of acoustic and electrical imbalance events recorded during a magnet current ramp, prior to quenching at 10.870 kA. The data splits across four graphs showing: (a) current intensity over time (seconds), (b) maximum sound amplitude (in arbitrary units), (c) frequency of the strongest detected sound, and (d) power spectrum of the acoustic signal recorded at the highest current level (~10800 A). Points in the plots indicate individual acquisition cycles (0.2 s each). Below 5 kA, only weak sound signals tied to imbalance were registered; at 8.5 kA and above, strong unassociated acoustic emissions began, peaking around 10-10.5 kA where they correlate with imbalance spikes. The analysis underlines the use of acoustic emissions for superconductor condition monitoring and diagnosing flux jumps and other anomalies during ramping.",

Figure (b) depicts typical signal waveforms between sensors where a 0.13 ms time difference, indicative of the sound velocity in the coil, suggests that events closer to sensor A result in clearer readings. This methodological setup aims to characterize sound wave propagation across the coil and verify sensor operation and positioning efficiency .",

The vertical axis represents power on a logarithmic scale and the horizontal axis frequency (in kHz). The figure demonstrates a pronounced presence of resonant peaks below ~10 kHz, with negligible activity beyond, reflecting the magnet's resonance behavior mainly within low-frequency zones.
