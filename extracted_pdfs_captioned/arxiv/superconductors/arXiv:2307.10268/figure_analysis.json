      "caption": "This figure displays the performance of Nb3Sn-coated CEBAF accelerator cavities in terms of quality factor (Q₀) as a function of accelerating gradient (E_acc) in MV/m. Black squares represent the cavity performance during the qualification test, while red circles show performance in the post-pair test, both conducted at 4.4 K. The performance plot illustrates the Q₀ degradation post-assembly, reflecting the preservation of low-field surface resistance but with a strong Q-slope limiting the gradient. This data is crucial in understanding the impact of assembly on superconducting properties, guiding improvements to prevent performance loss【4:1†temp_paper_b5e23ae4597bf1628f58c31fb503aed1.txt】.",
