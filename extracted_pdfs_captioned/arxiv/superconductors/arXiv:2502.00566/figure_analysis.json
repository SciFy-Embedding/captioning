      "caption": "Figure 5 illustrates the temperature-dependent transverse relaxation rate (T2^-1) of Nb3Sn powder at 9.43 T derived from Sample 2. The data, represented by dots, show both Lorentzian (green dots) and Gaussian (red dots) contributions, achieved through fitting the recovery curves. The Lorentzian component further divides into a Redfield component (purple curve) and a dipolar component (blue curve). The Redfield component is derived from the initial longitudinal relaxation rate (T1^i), depicted in the inset. This figure demonstrates the magnetic field's effect on relaxation components, highlighting sample-specific phenomena like vortex dynamics which do not manifest in Sample 2, indicating vortex pinning in contrast to Sample 1. This nuanced separation emphasizes the interaction dynamics within the superconducting state, significant for understanding Nb3Sn's superconducting properties.",
