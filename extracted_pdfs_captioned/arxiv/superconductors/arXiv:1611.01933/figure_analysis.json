      "caption": "Figure 1 displays the probability density distribution of critical temperatures (T) ranging from 13 K to 19 K. The graph compares calorimetry data with theoretical models of intra-granular Sn gradient impacts: no intra-granular Sn gradient (dashed gray) versus a 1.5% intra-granular Sn gradient (solid blue). The findings suggest that the presence of intra-granular Sn gradients significantly broadens the critical temperature distribution, matching the calorimetry data (dotted red line), indicating that such gradients effectively represent the actual Sn distributions in Nb3Sn multifilamentary superconductors .",
