      "caption": "Figure 5 shows the temperature (T) dependence of the inverse of the product of spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/(T1T)) for 133Cs and 13C in the A15 phase at pressures above the critical pressure (pc) of approximately 7.6 kbar. The left y-axis represents the relaxation rate 1/(T1T) in units of s^-1K^-1, while the right y-axis displays the 133Cs NMR shift (K) in percentage. The data for different isotopes and pressures are distinguished by symbols: blue diamonds for A15-133Cs at 7.6 kbar, black circles for A15-13C at 9.3 kbar, and red triangles for fcc-133Cs at 7.6 kbar. The A15 phase exhibits a decrease in 1/(T1T) as the temperature approaches the superconducting transition temperature (Tc-A15), indicating the opening of a superconducting gap, which is slightly above the observed decrease in Knight shift (133K). The trends are significant for understanding the persistence of spin fluctuations and the opening of the superconducting gap specifically in the A15 phase above the critical pressure, indicative of similar spin dynamics evolution across pressures in the fcc phase as well.",

      "caption": "Figure 2 presents (a) the anisotropic shift contribution (Kax) to the 13C NMR spectra and the linear relation with magnetic susceptibility (Ï‡) based on SQUID data on sample A1 (A15 phase) with temperature above 100 K at ambient pressure; and (b) the temperature dependence of 133Cs spin-lattice relaxation rate (T1T)-1 for the fcc phase T site and the A15 phase. The graphs demonstrate a similar paramagnetic behavior above 100 K across both phases but significant variance in their magnetic states below that temperature. The data serve to illustrate how spin dynamics and susceptibility correlate in the two phases and their transitions under different ambient conditions, contributing to understanding the effects of pressure on superconducting states .",

Panel (a) shows critical pressures of Mott transitions merging in the gray area, while panel (b) demonstrates overlapping critical pressure and transition temperature Tc for both the A15 and fcc phases when plotted against V^C60, highlighting the pressure-induced superconducting transition. The results underscore the orthogonality between pressure dependencies and the role of Mott transition as a driver for superconductivity, emphasizing correlation and Jahn-Teller effects in these phases .",
