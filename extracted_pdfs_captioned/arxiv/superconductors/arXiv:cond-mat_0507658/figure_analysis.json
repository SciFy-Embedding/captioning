      "caption": "This figure illustrates the real part of the first harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility (χ'1) as a function of temperature (T) measured across various DC magnetic fields. The data reflect the detection of the Peak Effect, revealing a widened superconducting transition at lower fields and a notable dip between 3T and 13T, which becomes less pronounced at higher fields. This effect is no longer detectable in magnetic fields exceeding 13T, indicating the limits of the effect with increasing field strength. The Peak Effect in this context is significant as it relates to the transition between the disordered phase and the Bragg Glass phase in Nb3Sn. Such a transition has been critically observed up to 19T for the first time here using the third harmonics analysis, underpinning the universality of the phase diagram for type II superconductors.",

      "caption": "The figure presents Cole-Cole plots of the third harmonics (χ''3 vs. χ'3) at different DC magnetic fields. These plots reveal the non-linear magnetic responses associated with the Bragg Glass phase and the disordered phase. At low fields, these plots align well with the Bean model predictions, featuring a closed loop. However, at higher fields where the first harmonics no longer detect the Peak Effect, the Cole-Cole plots evolve, exhibiting a no-loop structure that diminishes in area with increasing fields. This indicates a significant toolset improvement with third harmonic measurements over the first, extending phase transition observations to fields above 13T.",

      "caption": "This figure showcases the dependence of the third harmonic's imaginary part (χ''3) on its real part (χ'3) through Cole-Cole plots at various DC magnetic fields, with an inset reflecting theoretical computation via the Bean model. As field strength increases, a reduction in the plot area and transition from a loop to no-loop structure denotes the diminishing non-linearity, a signature of the Peak Effect, impacting the transition between the Bragg Glass phase and the disordered phase. These plots underscore the superiority of third harmonics in unveiling magnetic transitions that first harmonic measurements fail to detect beyond 13T.",

It plots critical and peak temperatures across various DC magnetic fields, delineating the transition boundary between the disordered phase and the Bragg Glass phase in Nb3Sn. This transition is crucial as it has been extended for observation beyond 13T using third harmonics, verifying theoretical predictions and highlighting the harmonics' sensitivity to intricate phase transitions in type II superconductors.",

These measurements, contrasting with those of the first harmonics, remain detectable up to 19T and indicate the phase transition point between the disordered and the Bragg Glass phase even when first harmonics measurements become inconclusive. The ability of third harmonics to effectively map these transitions, thus extending understanding of the field-temperature phase space, highlights their essential role in superconductivity studies.",
