Panel (a) shows Δ(1/Q), representing the inverse quality factor changes, indicating damping losses in the resonator system. As the temperature increases, losses become more pronounced, indicating a rise in resistive losses at higher temperatures and fields. Panel (b) illustrates Δν0/νref, where ν0(T, H) denotes the resonant frequency at temperature T and field H, and νref represents the resonant frequency at the critical temperature (Tc). Changes in frequency reflect dynamic adjustments within the superconducting state as affected by temperature and magnetic field. These data reveal critical transitions and energy dissipation behaviors that are essential for understanding vortex dynamics in superconductors, providing insights into interactions at varying field strengths .",
