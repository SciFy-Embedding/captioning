      "caption": "Figure 1 shows the cross-section of an unreacted Nb3Sn strand used in the comparative study of ITER strand characteristics between the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) and the University of Twente (UT). The image provides a close-up view of the internal structure, revealing individual components of the strand, which include filament arrays crucial for superconducting properties. This detailed visualization supports the strand's assessment under specified experimental conditions, highlighting its structural uniformity and material integrity which are foundational to accurately evaluating its performance after heat treatment.",

The panel (a) depicts measurements from both NHMFL and UT along with the difference (*Ic*_UT - *Ic*_NHMFL), which varies randomly around zero, indicating minor differences between labs. Panel (b) presents a direct comparison plot of UT *Ic* against NHMFL *Ic* with the diagonal line indicating ideal agreement, demonstrating consistent measurement practices and cross-validation of results between the two laboratories.",

In panel (a), *n* values from each lab are shown alongside their differences (UT - NHMFL). This panel highlights negligible systematic differences, with most deviations attributed to intrinsic wire variations. Panel (b) offers a correlation plot of UT *n* versus NHMFL *n*, where the diagonal line signifies perfect agreement, reinforcing the reliability of results from both facilities.",

In panel (a), RRR measurements from both institutions are depicted, along with the variance (UT - NHMFL). The close clustering around zero suggests high agreement between labs. Panel (b) shows a correlation plot for UT RRR against NHMFL RRR, emphasizing the small variance and demonstrating reliable mutual verification of RRR values.",
