      "caption": "Figure displays the volume fraction of the zero-field SR signal (ZF) at varying applied magnetic fields (μ0H0) and mean muon implantation depths (⟨z⟩) for LTB Nb and Nb3Sn(2 μm)/Nb samples. The x-axis shows the external field strength in mT, while the y-axis represents the volume fraction of the ZF signal. The data points depict experimental values, with solid colored lines fitting a logistic function to guide the eye. The fitted lines indicate logistic curves characterizing the transition from zero- to full-vortex penetration. Key findings include that in LTB Nb samples, 0vp displays a strong depth dependence aligned closely with the lower critical field (μ0Hc1), while in Nb3Sn(2 μm)/Nb samples, 0vp is independent of depth and closer to the superheating field (μ0Hsh). This signifies distinct flux penetration behaviors attributable to depth-dependent near-surface pinning in LTB Nb and a protective surface energy barrier in Nb3Sn(2 μm)/Nb.",

      "caption": "This figure features typical time-differential muon spin rotation (SR) data for surface-treated Nb, illustrating signal evolution with changing applied magnetic fields (μ0H0). Panel (a) shows waveforms over several microseconds, while panel (b) focuses on initial 0.5 microseconds to highlight initial dynamics. The x-axis refers to time after muon implantation in microseconds, and the y-axis represents the modulated amplitude as a proxy for local magnetic environments. Notably, data characterizes change across four magnetic states: normal state, Meissner state, mixed state, and vortex state. Solid lines denote fittings via Equation (6) to the experimental data, corroborating theoretical dynamics. The significance lies in demonstrating SR signal differentiation correlating with field penetration and transition width, offering insights into magnetic state evolutions related to pinning and surface energy interactions.",

In panel (a), μ0Hvp values are plotted against implantation depth, showcasing Nb3Sn(2 μm)/Nb's depth-independent high μ0Hvp near superheating levels, contrasting with LTB Nb whose μ0Hvp incrementally raises with depth. Panel (b) indicates normalized transition widths (Δμ0Hvp/z), asserting uniform stopping distributions, with averages shown by dotted horizontal lines. This measurement informs stratification effects on magnetic transitions, highlighting effective pinning and energy barriers crucial for understanding and optimizing SRF cavity performance.",
