      "caption": "Figure 1 describes the variations in material parameters such as critical temperature (T<sub>c</sub>), resistivity (ρ), electronic heat capacity coefficient (γ), Debye temperature (θ<sup>D</sup>), and the ratio B<sub>c2</sub>(0)/(Δk<sub>B</sub>T) as functions of tin (Sn) content (β) within the A15 range of Nb<sub>1-β</sub>Sn<sub>β</sub>. The experimental data points are shown alongside solid lines representing global fits, indicating trends as Sn content varies. The figure illustrates that T<sub>c</sub> and ρ decrease moderately up to about 24 at% Sn, beyond which T<sub>c</sub> saturates, suggesting a spontaneous cubic-tetragonal phase transformation affecting lattice stiffness and superconducting characteristics. This helps to understand how compositional changes impact superconductivity in Nb3Sn, vital for optimizing high-performance superconductors.",

Identifiable parameters are listed in the inset. The 'dirty' sample labeled 25Sn-1800 shows higher B<sub>c2</sub> across temperatures due to larger resistivity, even though T<sub>c</sub> decreases. These insights support theoretical predictions regarding the influence of composition on superconducting properties, highlighting the complex interplay between resistivity and critical fields in determining the performance of Nb3Sn as a superconductor.",
