      "caption": "Figure 2 illustrates a schematic of vortex rectification mechanisms occurring at different AC current amplitudes, characterized into four distinct regions I to IV. The sliding potential, oriented at θ = 45°, dictates the 'easy' and 'much easier' directions for vortex movement, as denoted by thick black arrows. Red and blue arrows indicate the Lorentz force direction for +Ia and -Ia respectively, affecting vortex dynamics. This figure elucidates the impact of dynamic pinning on vortex behavior and rectification under varied current amplitudes, which is significant for understanding vortex motion direction preferences in superconductors.【4:19†temp_paper_44f5e5b112bc897e62daefe382d515ad.txt】",
