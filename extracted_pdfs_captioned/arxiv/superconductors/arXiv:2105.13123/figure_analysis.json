      "caption": "Figure 2 depicts the density of states (DOS) for H3S at various pressure points of 209 GPa, 151 GPa, 101 GPa, and 64 GPa (upper panel), showing the behavior of the electronic structure under different pressures. The axes indicate DOS (states per cell per electronvolt) against energy relative to the Fermi energy (E-EF) in electronvolts. The different lines show varied pressure conditions, revealing shifts in DOS peaks with increased pressure. The lower panel shows the DOS for a 64-site supercell of H3S under ordered (blue line) and disordered (red line) conditions at 209 GPa, emphasizing the influence of disorder on the electronic structure. The findings highlight that increasing pressure enhances DOS peaks near the Fermi level, potentially contributing to the superconductor's properties despite disorder effects .",

      "caption": "Figure 5 presents a three-dimensional phase diagram demonstrating the multigap superconducting dome for a theoretical model based on quantum stripes, representing a superconductor's critical temperature (Tc) in Kelvin as a function of electron-phonon coupling constant (λ) and the Lifshitz parameter η defined as the energy separation between chemical potential (μ) and energy of the Lifshitz transition normalized by transverse energy dispersion. The plot illustrates how varying η impacts Tc, with observed maxima at η values characteristic of room-temperature superconductivity. The figure signifies the complexity of the superconducting state and its potential to achieve high Tc values through strategic manipulation of electron pairing and lattice coupling at a Lifshitz transition, contributing to the understanding of achieving superconductivity above 200K .",

      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates the prediction of a superconducting dome at a Fano resonance with panels showing Tc (critical temperature) versus η (a parameter representing the Lifshitz transition) in both linear (Panel A) and logarithmic (Panel B) scales. The data reflects theoretical calculations with varying intraband coupling constants g = 0.25 and g = 0.33, showing maximum critical temperatures for compounds CSHx and H3S. The peaks in Tc suggest that Fano-type resonances near a Lifshitz transition coalesce into superconducting phases viable for Tc enhancements under specific structural and electronic conditions. This finding is significant as it indicates that superconductors with suitably tuned band structures can potentially exhibit room-temperature superconductivity by optimizing interband interactions .",

Panel (a) depicts the architecture of superconducting wires within spacer materials, emphasizing the modular and structural characteristics intended to exploit superconducting properties. Panel (b) delineates the nanoscale Im³m symmetry structure of H3S, highlighting the arrangement of hydrogen wires (green dots) within the sulfide spacers, essential for maximizing Tc at extreme pressures. Panel (c) illustrates the relationship between applied pressure and the resulting compressive strain of the crystal lattice, illustrating how strain increases with pressure and culminates in optimal conditions that maximize the Tc as indicated in panel (d), which plots Tc as a function of pressure for hydrides like H3S and CSHx. This figure underlines the critical role of structural engineering and strain management in designing materials capable of supporting high-temperature superconductivity .",
