      "caption": "Figure 1 depicts the reduction of the critical current (Ic) relative to the initial critical current (Ic0) plotted as a function of the load per meter for IT-wire samples, comparing homogeneous load versus X-strands with a 4.7 mm spacing. The graph uses a logarithmic scale on the x-axis, representing load per meter in N/m, against the y-axis that denotes normalized critical current (Ic/Ic0). Key observations indicate that the homogeneous load maintains higher Ic/Ic0 values across increasing loads compared to X-strands. This suggests that the spatial distribution of load significantly impacts the performance of superconducting strands, essential for optimizing designs for structural integrity under magnetic load in ITER applications【4:0†temp_paper_0b03caa383b1e4ad8937f80e4ec9b410.txt】.",

The figure plots this reduction against applied stress measured in MPa, comparing two scenarios: homogeneous load distribution and point X-strands with 4.7 mm periodicity. As stress increases from 0 to 100 MPa, both conditions show a decrease in normalized critical current. However, the homogeneous load maintains relatively higher Ic/Ic0 values while showing a smoother decline than the X-strands. This data is crucial for understanding how local concentration of stress at contact points can exacerbate the strain effects on superconducting materials, influencing both the design and reliability of high-performance superconducting cables used in ITER.",
