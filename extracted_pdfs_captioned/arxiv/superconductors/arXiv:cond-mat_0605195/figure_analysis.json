      "caption": "The figure shows the SH signal intensity as a function of the static magnetic field, obtained by sweeping the magnetic field H₀ in the range ±15 Oe. The experiment was performed at an input peak power of approximately 30 dBm. The data reveal a hysteretic behavior, indicative of trapped magnetic flux within the MgB₂ superconductor sample. This implies that a critical state of the fluxon lattice develops in the sample near T_c. The SH signal reaches a peak and then decreases to zero as H₀ approaches the upper critical field. The presence of hysteresis highlights the role of trapped flux in influencing SH emission behavior.",

      "caption": "This figure illustrates the SH signal intensity as a function of temperature for an MgB₂ sample, with various external magnetic field strengths H₀ (10, 5, and 2 Oe). The input peak power is approximately 30 dBm, and normalization is to the maximal SH signal intensity detected at 10 Oe. The curves, which show peaks just below the critical temperature (T_c), broaden and shift to lower temperatures as H₀ increases. The dashed line represents the noise level of about −75 dBm. The continuous lines are fitted with a model assuming a linear temperature dependence of superconducting fluid densities.",

      "caption": "The figure presents the power dependence of the SH signal intensity for a fixed static magnetic field of H₀ = 2 Oe, at two different temperatures. The input power dependence is less than quadratic, deviating from a simple power law model. Continuous lines in the plot represent model fits that use parameters of λ₀/δ₀ = 0.11, and αᵢ = 2 × 10⁻³ Oe⁻¹. This analysis suggests that in MgB₂, the concentrations of normal and superconducting electrons are perturbed by electromagnetic fields, with a non-linear response occurring near T_c.",

At an input peak power of around 30 dBm, the data depict two curves normalized to the maximal SH signal intensity at 37.6 K, with the noise level indicated by a dashed line. A significant SH response is observed at H₀ = 0 in the descending field branch, suggesting flux trapping. Comparisons with model parameters highlight the dependence of maximum SH signal position on temperature, implying important temperature-driven changes in the superconducting state near T_c.",
