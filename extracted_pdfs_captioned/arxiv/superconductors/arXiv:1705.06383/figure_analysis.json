      "caption": "Figure 3 illustrates the dependence of the normalized fit parameter ea0 on the applied magnetic field H0, corrected for geometric enhancement. The graph portrays multiple samples: Nb (annealed at 1400°C), MgB2 coatings of varying thicknesses, and Nb3Sn, showing significant differences in behavior based on annealing and coating parameters. The data underscore that samples like MgB2 and Nb3Sn exhibit higher resistance to flux penetration, aligning close to the superheating field of the Nb substrate. This study highlights the crucial role of the proximity effect in increasing the magnetic shielding capabilities and suggests that the annealing and subsequent coating improves flux pinning characteristics, pushing the field penetration characteristics close to the superheating limit, which is pivotal for the development of efficient superconducting radiofrequency cavities.",

      "caption": "Figure 10 displays the entry field Hentry as a function of temperature for Nb3Sn and MgB2 samples. The plot indicates that Hentry for these materials exceeds the lower critical field Hc1 and approaches the superheating field of pristine Nb, showcasing a significant enhancement in these coated samples compared to bulk niobium. These findings are instrumental in advancing superconducting technologies, specifically highlighting how material and structural variations such as coatings and geometrical configurations affect superheating limits. The study provides insights into optimizing the design and processing of superconducting materials for enhanced performance in particle accelerators.",

      "caption": "Figure 9 presents experimental and simulation results comparing superheating fields of SNS and SN layered superconducting systems as a function of the normal conducting layer thickness, N. The upper panel shows that the SNS system achieves a higher superheating field for thinner N layers compared to SN systems. The lower panel graphically depicts the difference (∆Hsh = HSNS - HSN) in the superheating field, emphasizing how small thicknesses enhance performance due to the proximity effect. These results reinforce the notion that optimal layer thickness and composition can maximize superconducting properties, a critical consideration for developing multilayer nanostructures in superconducting applications.",
