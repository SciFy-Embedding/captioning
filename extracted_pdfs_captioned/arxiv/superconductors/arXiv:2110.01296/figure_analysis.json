      "caption": "Figure 10 illustrates the quality factor (Q0) measurements for different cavities at a resonance frequency around 8.8 GHz and a temperature of 4.5 K submerged in liquid helium, under varying magnetic fields. The plot presents data for Nb3Sn cavity, REBCO tape cavity, and a copper reference cavity, emphasizing the differences in performance against the magnetic field. Blue triangles, red circles, and an orange diamond signify measurements from Nb3Sn, REBCO tape, and Cu reference cavities respectively. Key results indicate that the REBCO cavity maintains a relatively constant Q0 between 60,000 to 80,000 up to 11.6 T, outperforming the copper cavity, whereas the Nb3Sn cavity shows a significant decrease in Q0 above 3 T, necessitating further investigation. These findings are significant for developing high Q-factor superconducting cavities suitable for axion dark matter detection experiments under high magnetic fields such as those required in RADES setups at CERN.",
