      "caption": "This figure shows the electric field-current (*E-I*) curves for RC5 and RC6 Racetrack Coils derived from resistive signals during parts of staircase current ramps where inductive signals were minimized. The data points indicate experimental measurements for RC5 and RC6 during ramp turns, while the fitted lines represent resistive losses following a power law (*V* ~ *I*n*) with *n*-value approximately 22 for RC5 and 24 for RC6, determined at a critical electric field criterion of 0.1 µV/cm. Critical currents (*I*c) were identified as 7550 A for RC5 and 7750 A for RC6. The depiction signifies the transition from superconducting to normal states, demonstrating the stability and uniform current sharing characteristic of Bi-2212 Rutherford cables in high-current conditions, underscoring the materials' potential in future high-field magnetic applications.",
