      "caption": "Figure 3 presents a comprehensive overview of the temporal dynamics and thermomagnetic behavior in a solenoid superconducting coil composed of Nb3Sn wire. Panel (a) depicts the voltage signal measured during an experimental test where a ramping transport current of 0.5 A/s was applied. The lower two panels in this section show simulated results for Joule heating power density and the maximum temperature over time, illustrating the correlation between temperature spikes and Joule heating during flux jumps. Panel (b) provides a contour plot indicating the number of flux jumps observed in each wire during the testing phase, revealing the distribution and frequency of instabilities. Panel (c) details the simulated distributions of current density, magnetic field, and temperature during the second documented flux jump, with a deeper focus on specific coil wires at coordinates (8, 9) and (28, 9). This figure demonstrates how current densities and thermal profiles evolve during flux jumps, emphasizing the importance of local conditions and defect distribution on instability propagation .",

      "caption": "Figure 6 illustrates the resistivity and quench propagation phenomena in Nb3Sn superconducting coils. Panel (a) shows the temporal evolution of resistivity during a flux jump at different coil locations, demonstrating a rapid increase towards the normal state value, ρ<sub>n</sub>—a critical marker for quench onset. This is highlighted by a dashed red line at 0.95ρ<sub>n</sub>. Panel (b) follows quench evolution through six temporal stages, marking regions that transition from superconducting to a quenched state, demonstrating non-uniform propagation. Panel (c) captures the velocity field of the quench propagation with arrows showing the quench movement directions, emphasizing faster quench spread in left-side wires. Panels (d, e, f) showcase critical parameters during the quench: temperature (T<sub>q</sub>), instantaneous Joule heating power density (P<sub>q</sub>), and the accumulated Joule heating (Q<sub>q</sub>) from quench onset until complete transition. These visualizations underscore the impact of thermal and electromagnetic conditions on quench dynamics .",
