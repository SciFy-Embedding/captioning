      "caption": "This figure presents the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity (k_Cu) of copper in Nb3Sn wires across three samples: PIT#1, BR#1, and IT#1. The data is shown from 5K to 45K. Each subplot represents a different sample labeled as 'Cu only', indicating measurements where copper is the primary conducting medium. The black squares are experimental data points, the dashed lines denote theoretical curves calculated based on measured RRR values, and the solid lines are the best fit curves derived to match the experimental data. This figure highlights the variability of thermal conductivity with temperature and the different sample preparations. The presented trend shows peak thermal conductivity at low temperatures, which is influenced by copper purity, relevant for assessing the thermal stability of superconducting magnets using different fabrication techniques.",

The solid line represents the best fit curve derived from a least squares fitting approach, treating RRR as a free parameter. It signifies how the thermal conductivity of copper, an essential parameter for superconducting magnet stability, peaks around 40K. These measurements offer valuable insights into the intrinsic thermal properties of copper, crucial for optimizing superconducting materials under cryogenic conditions.",
