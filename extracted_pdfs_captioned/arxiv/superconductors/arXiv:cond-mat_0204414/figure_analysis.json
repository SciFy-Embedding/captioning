      "caption": "Figure 6 illustrates the magnetic field dependence of the quasiparticle longitudinal thermal conductivity (κ/T) for the superconductors LuNi2B2C and V3Si. The magnetic field (H) is measured in Tesla and is plotted on the x-axis, while κ/T is measured in milliwatts per Kelvin squared (mW/K²) on the y-axis. The dashed line represents theoretical predictions for LuNi2B2C, and the solid line represents predictions for V3Si, computed from Equation (33). Experimental data points from Boaknin et al. are plotted as filled circles for comparison. A vertical dotted line depicts the upper critical magnetic field transition (Hc2) at 7 Tesla for LuNi2B2C, whereas the Hc2 for V3Si at 18.5 Tesla is not shown on this axis. The significance of this figure lies in the comparison of thermal conductivity under magnetic fields between two distinct superconductors, highlighting that thermal transport is significantly higher in LuNi2B2C than in V3Si at equivalent magnetic fields. This observation suggests different distributions of gapless excitations at the Fermi surface between these two materials, impacting their superconducting properties and thermal transport behavior in magnetic fields.",
