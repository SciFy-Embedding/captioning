The x-axis shows the magnet current as a percentage of the short sample limit, and the y-axis represents the delay time in milliseconds. Different lines indicate heater delay behaviors at various coil turns and temperatures, illustrating how reductions in current increase the heater delay, particularly at lower temperatures and different coil turns.

As heater power increases to about 30 W/cm², the delay time significantly decreases before reaching a plateau, indicating diminishing returns past this point.
