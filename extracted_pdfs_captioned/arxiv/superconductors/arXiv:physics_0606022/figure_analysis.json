      "caption": "Figure 1 portrays the impact of magnetic gradient on power losses due to radiative Bhabha interactions for the High Luminosity beam parameter set at 500 GeV in an optimized NbTi final doublet. The plot features a solid line representing power losses using the optimized magnet and a dotted line signifying the losses with an additional 20% magnetic gradient. The x-axis indicates the magnet scale factor, while the y-axis displays power loss in watts. This figure demonstrates a notable reduction in power losses with an enhanced magnetic gradient, which is crucial to minimize the risk of quenching in superconducting magnets during particle beam transport【4:0†temp_paper_a874401bbb678191b5e62613a3ef8c88.txt】.",
