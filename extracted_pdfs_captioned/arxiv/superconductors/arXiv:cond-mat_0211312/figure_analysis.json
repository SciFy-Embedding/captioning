      "caption": "Figure 0: This figure displays the thermal conductivity (κ) and heat capacity (δC/T) of NbSe2, normalized to their respective normal state values, plotted against H/Hc2. Panel (a) shows how δC/T increases sharply beyond Hc1, while κ/T exhibits a slower, activated-like increase, consistent with localized states at low fields. Panel (b) normalizes thermal conductivity vs (H−Hc1)/H* for both NbSe2 and V3Si, illustrating the scaling difference with H* = Hc2/9 for NbSe2. Panel (c) presents the ratio of thermal conductivity to specific heat in NbSe2, highlighting two regimes: a rapid increase below H* and a slower one above. These findings emphasize multiband superconductivity's role, where field-dependent delocalization of quasiparticle states affects thermal properties.",

      "caption": "Figure 1: The figure depicts the thermal conductivity of NbSe2 at various magnetic fields, presented as κ/T versus T^2. The solid line represents the Wiedemann-Franz law's expected value based on resistivity measurements (H = 4.5 T). The experimental setup aligns the magnetic field parallel to the c-axis and perpendicular to the heat current. As temperature approaches zero, this plot differentiates electronic from phononic conductivities, revealing a finite electronic contribution when Hc1 is exceeded. Notably, above Hc2, thermal conductivity adheres to the Wiedemann-Franz law, confirming the superconducting-to-normal transition and highlighting the importance of this relationship in probing the excitation spectrum of NbSe2.",

(b) The panel displays a theoretical curve for the thermal conductivity of V3Si, juxtaposed against experimental data reflecting the electronic contributions to conductivity. (c) Presents κ/T vs H for NbSe2 at temperatures of 130 mK and 900 mK, revealing the influence of phonon scattering and electronic contributions, particularly when the field reaches Hc1. These datasets underscore the presence of delocalized quasiparticles and distinct superconducting phases crucial for understanding thermal transport in superconductors.",

The plots normalize data to respective Hc2, providing insight into heat transport properties across different superconductors. (a) Displays data for NbSe2, with two distinct measurement approaches for heat capacity, highlighting the equivalence between thermal conductivity and specific heat under field scaling, indicative of multi-band superconductivity. (b) Shows MgB2's results, suggesting a notable shoulder due to multiband effects. (c) Covers V3Si, marked by theoretical expectations that differentiate it from MgB2 and NbSe2.
