      "caption": "This figure shows the temperature dependence of the cotangent of the Hall angle (cot Θₕ) for MgB₂, measured in a magnetic field of 5 T from 40 to 300 K. The x-axis represents T^1.8 in units of 10³ K, and the y-axis represents cot Θₕ (x 10³). The data points depict a linear relationship, following a + bT^1.38 across the temperature range, suggesting that MgB₂'s charge transport behavior is similar to high-Tc superconductors. The scientific significance lies in understanding the positive charge carriers in MgB₂, contrasting with other metal diborides, and providing insights into its superconducting mechanism, reinforcing a model of two different scattering times with differing temperature dependencies in superconductors.",

      "caption": "This figure presents the temperature dependence of the longitudinal resistivity (ρₓₓ) for MgB₂ samples measured from 0 to 300 K. The main plot shows ρₓₓ (μΩ cm) on the y-axis and temperature (T, K) on the x-axis, demonstrating a T² behavior and a sharp transition near the superconducting transition temperature Tc. The upper inset illustrates the six-terminal method used for measurement, indicating the configuration for current path and voltage measurements. The lower inset displays the low-field magnetization curve under zero-field-cooled (ZFC) conditions. The resistivity transition width is narrow (0.6 K), with ρₓₓ at 300 K comparable to single crystalline intermetallic superconductors. This figure is significant for confirming the metallic behavior of MgB₂ and its superconducting properties.",

      "caption": "This figure illustrates the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient (Rₕ) of MgB₂ measured at 5 T, with the main graph depicting Rₕ (x 10⁻¹² m³/C) against temperature (T, K). The data indicates a decreasing Rₕ with increasing temperature, demonstrating positive charge carriers similar to cuprate high-Tc superconductors. The inset shows Hall voltage versus magnetic field (H, T) for opposing field directions up to 5 T, confirming the linearity and symmetry of the Hall effect measurements. At 100 K, Rₕ is about 4.1 x 10⁻¹¹ m³/C. This figure is crucial for identifying the positive hole carriers in MgB₂ and supports the hypothesis of hole superconductivity in this material.",
