The figure clearly marks peaks associated with β-W, illustrating the dominance of this phase. The inset provides an enlarged view of diffraction intensity in the 76°-116° range. This characterization helps confirm the phase purity of the β-W films, showing no detectable α-W peaks within the instrumental uncertainty, indicating that β-W is the predominant phase in the substrate conditions used .",
