Axis labels include 'Non-matrix Jc' for the x-axis and 'RRR' for the y-axis. The data points are distinguished by color and shape to represent different sample groups. The key trend indicates that with increasing non-matrix Jc beyond approximately 1400 A/mm², the RRR values significantly increase. This illustrates the impact of the processing conditions and compositional variances among Nb3Sn strands. The significance of this visualization in the study highlights the optimization potential for achieving high RRR with substantial superconducting performance.",
