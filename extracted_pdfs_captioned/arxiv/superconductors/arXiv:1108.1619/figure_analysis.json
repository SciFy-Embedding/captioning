      "caption": "Figure 4: This schematic shows the block layout of the coil (one quarter of one aperture only) used in the proposed design for 20 T dipole magnets for the LHC. The layout utilizes a hybrid coil structure to optimize performance and cost, incorporating different superconductors: Nb-Ti for outer blocks achieving 8 T, Nb3Sn for blocks reaching up to 13 T, and HTS for the highest fields up to 20 T. This setup aims to balance the challenges of material costs and the distinct structural needs of the superconductors in a compact coil, crucial for high-energy particle accelerators like those in the LHC tunnel .",
