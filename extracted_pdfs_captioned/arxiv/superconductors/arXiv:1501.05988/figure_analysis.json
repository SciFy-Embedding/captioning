      "caption": "Figure 5 shows the time-dependent GENESIS simulation results for the NbTi case parameters with a 37.5 fs long electron beam having a flattop longitudinal profile. The left graph depicts the growth of the bunching factor along the undulator length, which significantly varies at different sections. The right graph shows the relative standard deviation of radiated power over input standard deviation as a function of undulator length, indicating power saturations. This figure demonstrates the limitations imposed by time-dependent effects in reaching peak output power, with a drop observed from 1.78 TW in the time-independent case to 1.55 TW after 120 m in the time-dependent analysis. Such effects are attributed to the growth of FEL synchrotron sidebands, which are highlighted here as a critical factor affecting the efficiency and fidelity of the FEL output in long undulator configurations.",

      "caption": "Figure 4 illustrates the radiation phase (on-axis) and trapping fraction from time-independent GENESIS simulations of the NbTi superconducting undulator. The graph on the left shows the radiation phase becoming more constant as the phase velocity of light approaches c beyond 40 meters of the undulator, indicating reduced gain. The graph on the right tracks the trapping fraction, showing a significant detrapment of particles as the resonant phase increases from zero to ψ<sup>r</sup> = 20° from z=10-50 m, trapping of approximately 20% of the beam occurs due to changes in the ponderomotive bucket. The figure highlights the need for mechanisms such as phase shifters to mitigate particle detrapping and sustain FEL performance.",

The left graph demonstrates the taper profile, while the right graph shows a comparison of power evolution for NbTi, Nb3Sn, and a permanent magnet undulator. For NbTi and Nb3Sn, a significant increase in output power over a permanent magnet design is observed, reflecting extraction efficiencies of 6.08% and 5.89% respectively. The simulations underscore the potential of superconducting technologies to achieve high output powers over the saturation power factor, thereby promoting their application in advanced FEL systems.",

The graph provides insights into how shorter sections facilitate lower transverse beam envelope oscillations and better emulate a continuous magnetic field profile, leading to improved FEL performance. It reveals that 1-2 m sections slightly improve output power between continuous and step tapering, whereas 3 m sections show reduced power from 1.3 TW to 0.5 TW. Consequently, a 1.5 m section length is deemed optimal, balancing interaction length and minimizing beam size oscillations.",

Sidebands intensify in regions where the synchrotron frequency changes less rapidly, especially in the latter sections of the undulator, causing detrimental impacts on the coherence and spectral purity of the FEL output. This visualization aids in understanding the effects of synchrotron motion on particle detrapping and informs strategies like varying the synchrotron frequency to mitigate these impacts, contributing to more robust FEL operation.",
