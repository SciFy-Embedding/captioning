      "caption": "Figure 3 shows the specific heat versus temperature for four Nb3Sn single crystal samples between 42 K and 53 K, highlighting the martensitic transition (TM). The data are recorded during warming and cooling cycles and reveal no apparent hysteresis, indicating a weak first or second order thermodynamic transition. There are significant variations in the size and onset of the martensitic anomaly between samples, with the martensitic temperature onset correlated inversely to the superconducting temperature onset. These differences may result from strain, compositional variances, or intrinsic properties linking the two transitions.",

It highlights the determination of the transition onsets and finals through straight line intersections on the plot. The sample onset temperatures vary slightly with the 9.5 mg sample showing the highest onset temperature. This variation implies a linkage between the density of electronic states at the Fermi level and the observed transitions.",
