      "caption": "Figure 3 illustrates (a) the Sn atomic composition and (b) the Nb/Sn+Ti or Nb+Ta/Sn ratios across the A15 layer for three different RRP® wires. The figure uses EDS sampling, where the typical sampled area is approximately 1μm in diameter, as indicated by the error bars. The compositions shown are averaged over the central regions of the A15 layers. This data reveals how doping affects the atomic composition and stoichiometry within the superconducting A15 phase, highlighting the greater uniformity of Ti-doped wires compared to their Ta-doped counterparts .",

A WHH extrapolation to 0 K is performed in the lower inset, while the upper inset presents FA15 curves at approximately 15 T. The Ti-doped samples demonstrate higher field performance and stability compared to Ta-doped wires, which have a noticeably lower Hc2(T). These results are significant for applications in high-field environments .",

The EDS maps highlight the distribution and concentration of these elements within the A15 phase layers, emphasizing areas of high Ti content at filament centers, which are typically Sn-poor regions. This underscores the enhanced diffusion properties of Ti, contributing to improved compositional homogeneity .",

The Ti-doped wires manifest a narrower Tc distribution compared to Ta-doped wires, which feature a broader distribution extending down to approximately 6 K. This reflects the non-equilibrium A15 reaction and superior phase uniformity in Ti-doped wires, enhancing superconducting performance .",
