      "caption": "Figure 1 shows the normalized pinning force data obtained via magnetometry, alongside the pinning force function f(b) and a comparison of the temperature dependencies of the upper critical field (Bc2) and the scaling field (B*c2) for the RRP-54 wire. The pinning force function is derived from the Unified Scaling Law (USL), reflecting the role of reduced magnetic field (b) and the scaling exponents p = 0.379 and q = 2.102 for the RRP-54 wire. The data is crucial for understanding deviations from ideal grain boundary pinning behavior and the peculiarities of Nb3Sn wire structures.",
