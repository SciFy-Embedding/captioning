      "caption": "Figure 1 displays the voltage (V) versus current (I) characteristics for CeH9 under a pressure of 125 GPa at different magnetic fields (B = 0.95 T, 1.95 T, 2.85 T, 4.75 T) at temperatures T = 55 K, 51.4 K, and 49.5 K. The y-axis represents voltage in microvolts (µV), and the x-axis represents current in milliamperes (mA). The figure consists of three subplots (a, b, c) for each temperature. The voltage criterion Vc=1 mV (or Ec=200 µV/cm) is indicated. The curves depict a non-linear relationship under varying magnetic fields, which is critical to understanding the electric field vs. current relationship, particularly how the critical current pathway changes under different B and T conditions in CeH9. This analysis follows fitting to the equation V(I) = Vo + Vc(I/Ic)^n, which is typical in superconductor characterization .",

The x-axis plots the applied magnetic field (T) and the y-axis the n-value, a parameter indicative of the transition from a superconducting to a resistive state. The comparison shows lower n-values at higher fields across all samples, highlighting the deterioration of superconducting condensation under magnetic stress, which is a key to understanding the current carrying capacity and the stability of high-temperature superconductors like CeH9 under magnetic fields .",

      "caption": "Figure 4 depicts the correlation between the n-value and the critical current (Ic) for CeH9 under conditions of high pressure (125 GPa) across different temperatures (a: 55 K, b: 51.4 K, c: 49.5 K). The critical current is marked along the x-axis (mA), whereas the n-value is along the y-axis. The red shaded region represents the confidence bands for the fit, incorporating the formula n(Ic)=1 + a(Ic)^s, indicating the power law relationship. The deduced power law exponents (s) range between 0.41 to 0.52, correlating closely with data for polycrystalline Nb3Sn, signifying similarities in the superconducting characteristics between CeH9 under pressures and more traditional superconductors .",

The reduced critical current ratio is plotted on the y-axis against the applied field (T) on the x-axis. Both the CeH9 and HTS wires show a decrease in critical current with increasing applied fields, emphasizing similarities in in-field behavior between this novel high-pressure superhydride and traditional high Tc superconductors like Bi-2223. These results validate the robustness of CeH9's superconducting properties under applied fields, suggesting potential practical applications in magnet-heavy environments .",
