      "caption": "Temperature-dependent magnetization (panels a and b) and magnetization-field (ΔM-H) loops (panels c and d) for the high-entropy alloy superconductors Nb3Al0.2Sn0.2Ge0.2Ga0.2Si0.2 (sample #1) and Nb3Al0.3Sn0.3Ge0.2Ga0.1Si0.1 (sample #2). Magnetization was measured after zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) at a magnetic field of 10 Oe. Panels (a) and (b) reveal the onset of superconductivity indicated by large diamagnetic signals below 9.0 K for #1 and 11.0 K for #2, while panels (c) and (d) display typical M-H loops at 2.0 K, suggesting the measured samples exceed 100% shielding. The critical current density (Jc) indicates slightly higher values for sample #2 than #1. This figure demonstrates the superconductor characteristics of these samples under low magnetic fields, providing insights into their potential applications in magnetic environments.",

      "caption": "The temperature dependence of the normalized electronic specific heat (C/T) data measured up to 9 Tesla for Nb3Al0.2Sn0.2Ge0.2Ga0.2Si0.2 (sample #1) and Nb3Al0.3Sn0.3Ge0.2Ga0.1Si0.1 (sample #2). Panels (a) and (b) illustrate that the specific heat shows a broad jump at Tc, which becomes more pronounced with increasing magnetic field, confirming bulk superconductivity. The respective Sommerfeld coefficients γ and the lattice specific heat β for both samples suggest strong-coupling behavior. Panels (c) and (d) focus on 0 Tesla, highlighting sharp superconducting transitions, more so in sample #1 than #2, indicative of strong superconducting states in a HEA scenario. These data solidify our understanding of HEA effects on thermodynamic stability and superconductivity.",

Panel (a) reveals metallic behavior and superconducting transitions at onset temperatures (Tc onset) of 9.0 K for #1 and 11.0 K for #2. Panels (b) and (c) expand on the resistivity transition under magnetic fields up to 9 T, showing Tc decreases with increasing H. Panel (d) depicts the magnetic field-temperature phase diagrams to determine the upper critical fields Hc2(0) using WHH models, estimated at 10.4 T for #1 and 13.3 T for #2. This figure underscores the significant impact of magnetic fields on the superconducting state in these novel samples.",

The lattice constants were refined using the Rietveld method and impurity phases of up to 8.5% (Nb5Si3) were detected, which are non-superconducting. Inset illustrates a schematic image of the refined crystal structure for sample #2. These patterns establish the fundamental structural characterization required to understand the atomic arrangements influencing superconducting properties.",
