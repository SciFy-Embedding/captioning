      "caption": "This figure presents the Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry (RBS) spectra of a vanadium film deposited on a silicon dioxide/silicon substrate (V/SiO2/Si) in its as-deposited state. The x-axis represents the channel number, which corresponds to energy, while the y-axis shows the normalized yield of backscattered ions detected by the spectrometer. The experimental data are shown as black triangles, while the red line represents the simulated RBS spectrum. The spectra components signify the Si, O/SiO2, and V layers, with 'O/SiO2' indicating oxygen from the silicon dioxide layer. Key observations include strong alignment between experimental and simulated data, confirming the Si, SiO2, and V layer thicknesses. This analysis provides a foundational understanding of the unreacted state of the V film, crucial for further studies on the transformation into superconducting V3Si films during annealing .",

The detected signals include Si, SiO2, V3Si, and VOx. The x-axis represents the energy in channels, while the y-axis shows normalized yield. Data arrangement and peaks indicate the V3Si layer's formation (63 nm thick) beneath a 280 nm thick VOx layer, signifying the phase transformation enabled by heat treatment. This spectral analysis is integral to confirming the multilayer structure, where annealing leads to elemental diffusion and compound formation, critical for developing vanadium silicide superconducting devices .",

The experimental data (black) and simulation (red) demonstrate agreement, except near the surface due to VOx irregularities, signifying complex depth-dependent kinetics. This deeper analysis reveals how higher annealing temperatures support silicide growth by accelerating SiO2 decomposition and diffusion processes, vital for understanding scalable production techniques of superconducting films .",
