      "caption": "Figure 9 depicts the temperature dependence of the grazing incidence (p-polarization) reflectivity ratio of polycrystalline MgB₂, normalized to the reflectivity at 45 K. The x-axis represents temperature in Kelvin (K), while the y-axis displays the reflectivity ratio Rp(T)/Rp(45 K). The reflectivity ratio exceeds one below the critical temperature (Tc = 39 K), indicating superconducting behavior. This phenomenon occurs as the reflectivity in the superconducting state becomes prominent, signifying the opening of the superconducting gap. The pronounced changes are associated with the condensation of carriers and an increase in reflectivity below Tc. This figure substantiates the behavior observed in conventional superconductors and supports the interpretation of the optical properties of MgB₂ as indicative of the energy gap associated with superconducting pair formation.",

      "caption": "Figure 7 illustrates the frequency dependence of the reflectivity ratio for polycrystalline MgB₂ at various temperatures in a superconducting state, measured in grazing incidence geometry (p-polarization). The x-axis indicates frequency in cm⁻¹, and the y-axis shows the reflectivity ratio Rp(T)/Rp(45 K). The spectra exhibit a significant raise below the critical temperature (Tc = 39 K) with a maximum observed between 25 and 30 cm⁻¹, aligning with theoretical predictions for a superconducting energy gap. The data demonstrates that the reflectivity ratio maximizes below the superconducting transition, aligning with models predicting the behavior of a non-uniform superconducting gap in this material. This graph provides crucial evidence of the optical response in MgB₂ being driven by the anisotropic superconducting gap and carrier condensation effects.",

      "caption": "Figure 15 displays the temperature dependence of the dc resistivity and magnetic susceptibility of MgB₂, including field-cooled (F.C.) and zero-field-cooled (Z.F.C.) data, along with the unit cell structure depicted in the inset. The main plot presents resistivity in micro-ohm centimeters (µΩcm) against temperature in Kelvin (K), showing a noticeable drop near the superconducting transition temperature (Tc = 39 K), consistent with superconducting onset. The inset shows magnetic susceptibility in emu/g versus temperature, highlighting changes around Tc, with rapid decreases suggesting a high superconducting fraction. The inset structural diagram demonstrates the hexagonal structure with magnesium and boron atoms. This figure collectively highlights the superconducting transition and structural properties of MgB₂, essential for understanding the physical characteristics underpinning its superconducting behavior.",
