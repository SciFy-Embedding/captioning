      "caption": "Figure 2 depicts the non-Cu critical current density (*Jc,non-Cu*) as a function of magnetic field for various advanced superconducting wires measured at 4.2 K. The plot includes data from reference wires and Advanced Pinning Center (APC) wires, such as T3882 and T3912, under different heat treatment conditions compared against the FCC specification curve. Key data points include various heat treatments like T3912 at 0.84 mm diameter and 700°C/71h, outperforming the FCC benchmark at higher fields. This figure illustrates the impact of heat treatment on the performance of APC wires, showing that reductions in heat treatment temperature lead to increased *Jc,non-Cu*. Scientifically, it highlights how different processing conditions can optimize superconductor performance for high-field applications.",

      "caption": "Figure 3 presents Sn concentration in Nb3Sn layers of selected wire samples and a schematic of EDS measurement spots. The figure highlights Sn content distribution from fine-grain (FG) to coarse-grain (CG) regions for wires with different dopant configurations such as Ta, Zr, and O. The Sn concentration in FG layers is shown to be significantly higher in Zr+O doped samples, close to stoichiometry, indicating improved superconducting properties due to enhanced Sn content. This data underscores the role of internal oxidation in boosting Sn incorporation, directly impacting the superconductor's critical properties.",

      "caption": "Figure 4 displays Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images of cross-sections for two types of APC Nb3Sn wires: (a) T3912-0.71 mm-700°C/71h and (b) T3912-0.84 mm-675°C/384h. The insets show the arrangement of fine-grain (FG) and coarse-grain (CG) regions within the wire filaments. Notable in these images is the higher percentage of FG areas in T3912 wires, nearly 50% higher than older generations like T3882, suggesting improved superconducting performance. These SEM images substantiate the influence of heat treatment parameters on the microstructural optimization of superconductors.",

      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates the normalized resistance versus applied magnetic field (*R*-*B*) curves for various Nb3Sn superconducting wires at 4.2 K. This includes reference wires, T3882, and T3912, with specific heat treatments like 675°C/300h and 675°C/384h. The plot captures the irreversibility field (*Birr*) and upper critical field (*Bc2*) for these wires, demonstrating APC wires with higher *Birr* and *Bc2* values compared to standard PIT and RRP® conductors. This signifies that ternary doping through APC significantly enhances critical field values, a crucial factor for high-field superconducting applications.",
