      "caption": "Figure 7(a-c) illustrates the comparative analysis of the magnetic properties of samples C and D, both reacted at 650°C for 150 hours. Panel (a) shows the normalized magnetic moment versus temperature curve, where Sample C (with SnO2) and Sample D (with NbO2) are highlighted. Panel (b) presents the pinning force density (Fp) as a function of the magnetic field, noting that the curves were fit to the universal scaling law (Fp=Kb^p (1-b)^q). A critical observation here is that Sample C, despite having smaller grain size, shows lower maximum pinning force (Fp,max) compared to Sample D. Panel (c) displays the reduced pinning force versus reduced field curves, indicating that Sample C's curve is shifted to a higher field due to the high fraction of sub-30 nm grains, while Sample D follows typical flux shear behavior. These findings underline the influence of grain size on magnetic performance, suggesting potential improvements in Nb3Sn conductors through grain size refinement practices.",

      "caption": "Figure 4(a-b) explores the transformation in magnetic properties and microstructure of Sample B under varying thermal conditions. Panel (a) exhibits magnetic moment versus temperature (M-T) curves of samples B, reacted at different temperatures, indicating that oxygen content in Nb increases with reaction temperature, culminating in NbO2 and NbO compounds forming at temperatures above 550°C. Panel (b) provides an SEM image of the microstructural changes in a sample reacted at 650°C for 40 hours, showing the formation of Nb-O compounds. This study warns against using excessive SnO2 for oxygen supply, as it leads to compound formation rather than solely increasing dissolved oxygen.",
