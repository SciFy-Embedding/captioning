      "caption": "Figure 3a. Critical current (Ic) as a function of heat treatment temperature at 12 Tesla magnetic field for Nb3Sn strands from JASTEC. The plot shows data for three different durations of heat treatment (80 hours, 100 hours, and 150 hours) at various temperatures (640°C to 660°C). The y-axis represents the critical current (Ic) measured in amperes (A), while the x-axis shows the heat treatment temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). The results indicate that the critical current remains stable across the studied temperature range within the experimental uncertainty. This suggests that moderate variations in heat treatment conditions do not significantly affect the critical current of JASTEC strands, an important consideration for large-scale applications in magnet technologies such as ITER. This stability is crucial for maintaining the performance of superconducting materials under variable heat treatment conditions.【4:14†temp_paper_b62a04e4a2ef5a353616c0f42a5d0bab.txt】",
