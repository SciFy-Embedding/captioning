      "caption": "Supplemental Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the total specific heat capacity (C/T) and electronic specific heat (Cel/T) for V3Ge, V3X-A, and V3X-B materials. The data have been derived by subtracting phonon contributions from the total specific heat to highlight the electronic contributions. This analysis is critical in assessing the superconducting properties and provides insight into the role of compositional complexity in altering the behavior of electron interactions at low temperatures compared to V3Ge. The findings underscore the broader superconducting transition in V3X samples compared to the pure V3Ge, indicative of the high-entropy phase's complexity impacts 【4:0†temp_paper_d272e124c16b65fff923decf8e8e5ab8.txt】.",

The diffraction data indicate the presence of broad peaks in V3X samples signifying high configurational disorder typical of high-entropy alloys. Notably, an impurity phase (VAl) is detected in V3X-B. This analysis helps elucidate the phase formation and structural complexity induced by multiple elements, which are pivotal for understanding the improved superconducting parameters in these compositionally complex alloys (CCAs) .",

This suggests enhanced vortex pinning due to the complex material structure of V3X samples. This figure supports the hypothesis that increased configurational entropy from multiple elements can alter electron scattering and thus improve critical magnetic fields (Bc2) .",
