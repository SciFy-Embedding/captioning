      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates the oscillatory component of magnetization (M_osc) normalized to the upper critical field (H_c2) for s-wave and d-wave superconductors as a function of the ratio H_c2(0)/B. Panel (a) represents s-wave symmetry, while panel (b) corresponds to d-wave symmetry. The plots showcase how the magnetization oscillates as the magnetic field varies, indicating a distinction between s-wave and d-wave states under varying magnetic fields. These findings are critical for understanding the vortex state's contribution to the dHvA effect, displaying that the oscillation damping is not significantly different between s-wave and d-wave types, suggesting that average gap plays the main role.",
