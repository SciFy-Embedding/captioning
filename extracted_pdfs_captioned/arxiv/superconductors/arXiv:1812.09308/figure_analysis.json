      "caption": "Panel (a) and (b) illustrate static convex hull diagrams of the Ag-Au alloy system, showing the enthalpy of formation (ΔH) on the y-axis against the Au content (%) on the x-axis. Each point represents the enthalpy of an individual phase. Solid lines denote convex hulls, indicating stable compositions, while points above these lines are metastable. AgAu2 metastable phases, highlighted in red and blue, have potential superconducting properties. Panel (c) shows the temperature-corrected convex hull diagrams incorporating vibrational entropic contributions for finite temperature stability. Panel (d) presents a temperature-composition phase diagram with temperature on the y-axis, displaying the stability range of Ag-Au alloys. Color-coded regions delineate temperature ranges where structural phase transformations occur, labeled by crystallographic space groups such as P4/mmm and Cmmm. These figures are significant in identifying promising structures and compositions for achieving superconductivity in Ag-Au alloys at low temperatures.",

      "caption": "The figure shows the evolution of predicted crystal structures for Ag-Au binary alloys. It plots enthalpy of formation (ΔH) in eV/atom on the y-axis against structure number on the x-axis. Colored points represent alloy compositions, with the inset at the upper-left indicating AgAu, AgAu2, AgAu3, AgAu4, and AgAu5 compositions. The enthalpies are calculated from ground state fcc Ag and Au structures, with an ordinate cut-off set for visual clarity. Structures with lower ΔH are thermodynamically favorable, and findings suggest complete miscibility in Ag-Au alloys demonstrated by negative ΔH. Identifying compositions with low ΔH is crucial for predicting superconductive potential in Au-rich alloys.",

This structural motif is consistent across stable Ag-Au alloy structures, suggesting classification as fcc variants. Significantly, this visual representation highlights structural analogues that can influence potential superconductive properties.",
