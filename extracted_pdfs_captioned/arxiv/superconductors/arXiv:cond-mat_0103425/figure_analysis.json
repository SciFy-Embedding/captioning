      "caption": "This figure shows the field (T) as a function of temperature (K) for three different MgB2 thin films (Film 1, Film 2, and Film 3), with Film 1 represented in blue, Film 2 in black, and Film 3 in red. The graph highlights the irreversibility fields (H*(T) bulk) and the upper critical fields (Hc2(T) bulk) for bulk MgB2. The data shows that Film 2 exhibits a much steeper slope in the H*(T) line compared to bulk samples, indicating higher high-field performance. This signifies that Film 2 has an enhanced critical field behavior due to its unique composition and processing conditions, which is of scientific importance for superconducting applications where high magnetic fields are required.",

Insets show Jc at extremely low temperatures (4.2 K for Film 3 in blue and Film 1 in red, and a range up to 25 K for others). Film 3 demonstrates the highest Jc value at low fields indicating superior current carrying capability, while Film 2 sustains higher Jc over a wide range of field strengths, especially advantageous for technological applications, emphasizing its potential as a high-performance thin-film superconductor.",
