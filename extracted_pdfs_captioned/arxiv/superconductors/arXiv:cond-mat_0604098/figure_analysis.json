      "caption": "Figure 3a: This panel shows the scaling of specific heat data using the 3d-XY model in low magnetic fields. Figure 3b: The scaling of specific heat according to the 3d-LLL (Lowest Landau Level) model is depicted, which becomes suitable at higher magnetic fields. The theoretical 3d-LLL model fits are included for reference. Figure 3c: Represents the 3d-XY model scaling of the derivative of magnetization, showing how magnetization responds to changes in magnetic field. These plots effectively highlight the crossover between the 3d-XY and 3d-LLL models in Nb3Sn superconductors. The scaling attempts to merge experimental data onto a common curve in each model, indicating universal scaling behavior and associating thermodynamic fluctuations with vortex dynamics in the superconductor.",

Vortex melting temperatures, indicated by arrows, show shifts under an AC field, indicating changes in vortex equilibrium dynamics. Figure 4b: The difference between the AC and no-AC field conditions is plotted, making the vortex melting transition anomalies more discernible, with an inset indicating a first-order transition at around 7 T via the magnetocaloric effect. Together, these figures illustrate the impact of AC fields on vortex melting phenomena, highlighting latent heat effects of the vortex transition.",
