      "caption": "FIG. 5 illustrates the temperature distribution on the SRF cavity surface and the attached Cu plate under 5 W of rf heat load and a static heat load of 0.58 W. The simulation, performed using ANSYS, reveals a uniform temperature across the cavity surface, closely matching the cryocooler's temperature due to the high thermal conductivity of the copper layer. The figure's color gradient represents temperature variations in Kelvin, ranging from 7.51 K to 7.64 K. This uniformity is significant for maintaining stability in superconducting conditions under conduction cooling, showcasing the effective heat management in the cavity design.",

      "caption": "FIG. 3 displays the quality factor (Q_0) of the multi-metallic SRF cavity as a function of peak surface magnetic field (B_p) and accelerating gradient (E_acc) in continuous-wave mode. Data for tests in liquid helium (LHe) without copper and with copper as well as using a cryocooler are presented. The inset provides a correlation between power dissipation and temperature with both direct cryocooler measurements and heater controlled tests at 4 K. The observed data highlight the Q degradation upon reaching a peak magnetic field at higher power levels due to thermal instabilities and surface defects, emphasizing the challenge of maintaining high superconducting performance in varying environments.",
