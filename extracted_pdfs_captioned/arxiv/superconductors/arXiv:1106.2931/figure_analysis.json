      "caption": "Figure depicts the ratio of eigenvalues λ_d/λ_s as a function of the inter-chain to intra-chain hopping ratio t2/t1. The y-axis represents the eigenvalue ratio and the x-axis shows the hopping ratio t2/t1. The data is visualized with connected data points, highlighting a decreasing trend of λ_d/λ_s as t2/t1 increases. This trend suggests a diminishing contribution of d-wave pairing relative to s-wave as interchain interactions become more pronounced. This finding is significant as it underpins the transition dynamics in superconductors, informing the stability of d-wave order under varying electron coupling scenarios.",

      "caption": "This figure presents the coefficients β and κ from the Ginzburg-Landau theory plotted against the ratio t2/t1. The left panel shows the normalized β coefficients, which describe fourth-order energy terms, while the right panel displays the normalized κ coefficients, representing the gradient terms. Both plots measure how these coefficients vary with changes in interchain and intrachain coupling. β coefficients display differential increase, implying selective enhancement of certain weak couplings. The κ coefficients illustrate similar behavior with some showing stronger tendency than others. These variations are crucial for understanding how superconductivity is affected by electron-phonon coupling mechanisms, with implications for stabilizing superconducting phases.",

This graphical representation allows for a detailed analysis of how the interplay between intra-chain and inter-chain couplings affects superconducting properties in A15 compounds. Signifying changes in the system's superconducting state, the graph aids in elucidating phase transformations by highlighting specific coefficients like β1, β3, and κ1 as dominant. The insight gained is pivotal in refining theoretical models of superconductivity, specifically regarding the modification of gap symmetries.",

Using a color scale to indicate relative gap values, it offers a visualization of dx2−y2 -like symmetry gaps inherent in these superconductors, represented via red and yellow regions. This suggests a non-uniform distribution of energy gaps across the surface, pertinent for understanding superconducting gap anisotropy and its stability under varying coupling conditions.",
