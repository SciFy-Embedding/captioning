      "caption": "This figure depicts the logarithmic scale of surface reactance versus T/Tc, where T is the temperature and Tc is the critical temperature. The data shown are for two samples, #1 (blue circles) and #2 (red squares). In this plot, the slopes of the linear portions at T < Tc/3 give the values of the smaller superconducting gap Δ2(0). These slopes, reflected in the values Δ2(0)/Tc of 0.97 and 0.93 for samples #1 and #2 respectively, are significantly less than the BCS theory's standard expectation. The dashed line represents the slope expected from a single-gap BCS theory, highlighting the deviation in these two-band superconductors. The scientific significance here lies in illustrating the presence of a smaller energy gap, indicating divergence from traditional single-gap BCS superconductors, thus supporting two-gap superconductivity in V3Si samples.",

      "caption": "This figure illustrates the temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the conductivity σ''(T)/σ''(0) for two V3Si samples (sample #1 shown as circles, sample #2 as squares) and a Pb2Mo6S8 crystal (shown as diamonds). Solid lines correspond to predictions from the weak-coupling two-band theory using the parameters g11, g22 listed for each sample. The dashed, dotted, and dash-dotted lines show single-band BCS theoretical predictions at different temperatures. The experimental results diverge from these single-band predictions, demonstrating qualitative agreement with the two-band theoretical model, namely at temperatures below 16 K. This supports the theory that the mechanism of superconductivity in these samples involves multiple energy bands, challenging the single-gap model employment in traditional superconductor descriptions.",

      "caption": "This plot represents the temperature dependence of the superconducting gaps Δ1 and Δ2 calculated with equation (1) for a superconductor with two critical temperatures, Tc = 16.5 K and Tc = 12.5 K. The solid and dashed lines show Δ1 and Δ2, respectively, for the higher Tc superconductor, while dotted and dash-dotted lines are for the lower Tc variant. These variations in the gap behaviors are aligned with weak-coupling two-band models rather than single-band models like BCS. The calculated variances underscore the existence of multiple gaps, a hallmark of multi-band superconductors, and consequently illustrate the insufficiency of a simplistic single-gap approach to comprehend the full complexity of superconductivity in these systems.",

      "caption": "Shown are temperature dependences of the real part of conductivity, σ′(T)/σ(T_c), for two V3Si samples (#1 in circles, #2 in squares) derived within a two-band model frame, with lines representing the theoretical fit. The data for sample #2 show a pronounced coherence peak around T~0.5T_c, explained by the two-band model, in contrast to the BCS prediction, which shows a peak at ~0.35T_c. The lack of a coherence peak in sample #1 is consistent with clean limit expectations. These results highlight deviations from single-band superconductivity behavior due to the interband scattering effects, thereby emphasizing the need for a two-band theoretical model in explaining superconducting properties of these samples.",

      "caption": "The figure details temperature dependences of the surface resistance (squares) and reactance (circles) for samples #1 (solid symbols) and #2 (open symbols). It clearly shows how R(T) and X(T) are comparable in the normal state up to about 35 K, confirming the normal skin effect assumption. The inset expounds resistivities in the normal state, revealing notable differences between the two samples, particularly sample #2's higher resistivity. The nonlinear temperature dependence of resistivity indicates a singularity in the density of states, pertinent to the specific electronic structure of V3Si. This analysis lays groundwork in recognizing different conductive characteristics based on the sample purity and preparation, vital for understanding nuanced superconducting behaviors under various experimental configurations.",
