      "caption": "Figure 4 displays the transverse resistance as a function of temperature measured on the OST-I wire (sample α) between bundles A-B (stars) and A-C (circles). It shows that the outer pure copper layer plays a significant role in maintaining low resistance values, as evidenced by the resistance increase when it is removed (open triangles, sample β). There is a notable decrease in resistance by 2-3 orders of magnitude around 18K, indicative of the Nb3Sn superconducting transition. This highlights the copper sheath as a preferential current path, crucial for optimizing current distribution in superconducting applications.",
