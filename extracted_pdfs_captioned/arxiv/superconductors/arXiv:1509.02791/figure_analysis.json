      "caption": "Figure 3 illustrates the angular dependence of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) frequencies compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. (a) The I phase (Pm¯3n) is compared to (b) the I' phase (I¯43d) and (c) a tetragonal phase with merohedral twinning. The y-axis represents the frequency in kT (kiloTesla), while the x-axis is the rotation angle φ in degrees, which refers to the angle between the applied magnetic field and the a-axis. Experimental data is displayed in false color, while calculated orbits from Fermi surface sheets are color-coded. The dynamic range is normalized to enhance the visibility of smaller peaks. A key finding is the discrepancy between observed and predicted frequencies in the tetragonal phase (c), suggesting that merohedral twinning is unlikely to account for the structural behavior at low temperatures. This points to a structural transformation rather than mere twinning, which is significant in understanding the lattice dynamics of Sr3Ir4Sn13 .",

      "caption": "Figure 2 presents the Fermi surface sheets of Sr3Ir4Sn13 in the I' phase, computed through density functional theory (DFT). The visualization depicts bands A', B', C', and D' within a rhombic dodecahedral Brillouin zone, reflecting the impact of superlattice distortion on the Fermi surface. Different colors represent different bands, highlighting the complex multiband nature of the electronic structure. These visualizations confirm the presence of multiple reconstructed sheets and support the theoretical model that characterizes the I' phase as a body-centered cubic lattice (I¯43d). This comprehensive mapping is crucial for understanding the superconducting properties of this compound, as it suggests potential routes for identifying multiband superconductivity .",

      "caption": "Figure 1 details the magnetoresistance and quantum oscillation data of Sr3Ir4Sn13. The upper panel shows resistivity versus magnetic field, with a background subtraction applied for field alignment at 42° from the a-axis. Oscillations are fitted using the Lifshitz-Kosevich theory, demonstrating alignment with experimental data. The middle panel reveals a Fourier transform of magnetic field sweeps, where main oscillation frequencies are marked, indicating the Fermi surface extremal areas. The inset plots resistivity versus temperature, revealing a residual resistivity ratio of 17. In the bottom panel, the amplitude of the 91 T frequency peak is plotted against temperature, fitted according to Lifshitz-Kosevich behavior. These results provide insights into the electronic structure and validate theoretical predictions, highlighting anisotropic electronic properties originating from the predicted Fermi surface .",
