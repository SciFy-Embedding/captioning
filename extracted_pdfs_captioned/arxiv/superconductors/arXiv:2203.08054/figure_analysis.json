      "caption": "This figure presents an overview of the proposed roadmap for high-field magnet development and associated technologies, focusing on the development of Nb3Sn and High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) conductors and magnets. The roadmap is segmented into multiple years (2022-2026 and beyond), illustrating a timeline for advancing Nb3Sn and HTS magnet technology, which encompasses achieving ultimate performance levels and integrating robust design, industrial manufacturing, and cost-effective production. The figure highlights key areas such as HTS material development, magnet technology innovation, cryogenics, and comprehensive testing phases that align with strategic development goals aiming for operational fields up to 16T and potentially beyond 20T for HTS. Technical emphasis is placed on industrialization and optimization of Nb3Sn, alongside HTS technology demonstration, representing a significant stride towards enhanced superconducting magnet performances critical for future particle accelerators. This roadmap embodies the innovation path required to meet objectives aligned with the European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP).",

      "caption": "This figure illustrates the distribution of resources in terms of material and personnel within the High-Field Magnet (HFM) programme. The left pie chart shows the allocation of material efforts, where Nb3Sn conductors account for 32% and 21% is allocated to HTS conductors, reflecting significant investment in superconductor procurement crucial for advancing magnet development. The right pie chart outlines personnel distribution, showing 38% devoted to Nb3Sn conductors, emphasizing the R&D efforts required to mitigate the material's brittle nature and optimize its application in high-field environments. HTS magnets receive 12% of personnel effort, emphasizing the dual-objective R&D: developing both hybrid and full HTS magnets to surpass the performance of current Nb3Sn standards. This distribution reflects the programme's strategy to sustain competitive technological advances while ensuring readiness for industrial scale-up, thereby supporting Europe's leadership in superconducting magnet technology by fostering a resilient and innovative industrial ecosystem.",
