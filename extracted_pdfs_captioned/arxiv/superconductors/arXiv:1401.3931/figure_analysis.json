      "caption": "Figure 5 shows the HQ time margin versus the local field detailed in Figure 1. The x-axis represents the magnetic field strength in Tesla (T), ranging from 0 to 15 T, and the y-axis depicts the time margin in milliseconds (ms), ranging from 0 to 50 ms. The plot illustrates the inverse relationship between field strength and time margin, indicating that as the local magnetic field increases, the time margin decreases. This figure is significant as it emphasizes the importance of considering field variations within superconducting magnets for quench protection and highlights the challenge of maintaining a sufficient time margin in high-field regions.",

The left section illustrates the one-layer coil option, and the right shows the two-layer coil design. This figure illustrates the structural differences and spatial arrangement of sections related to the quench protection strategy evaluation. Selecting between these coil designs impacts both the electromagnetic properties and the quench protection strategies, where the internal quench across various cable layers is a central feature when achieving reliable magnet performance at high currents .",

The y-axis represents the voltage in volts (V) which peaks between 500 and 1000 V, approximately. This analysis is critical in understanding how internal magnetic instabilities might lead to tolerances reaching the threshold, stressing the need for balanced designs in coil configurations to maintain functional safety and performance limits under operational conditions .",
