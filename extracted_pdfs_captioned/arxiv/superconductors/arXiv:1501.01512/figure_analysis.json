      "caption": "Figure 0 illustrates the dynamic behavior of vortex loops in a superconducting (S) layer with a surface defect, which reduces the threshold for vortex penetration. In panel (a), a vortex loop propagates as indicated by the circular arrow and the magnetic field direction H is perpendicular to the surface. The current density J is flowing parallel to the surface. Panel (b) demonstrates the formation of a vortex-antivortex pair due to interaction with the surface defect, represented by the black dot. This pair is indicative of the Meissner current's perpendicular impact on the vortex loop, which prevents its linear propagation beyond the I layer where most of the dissipative vortex core disappears in a flux channel. The significance of this figure lies in showing how such defects can affect vortex dynamics and stability within the layer, which is critical for understanding and optimizing the screening currents to prevent thermomagnetic avalanches and improve the superheating capabilities of superconducting materials.",

      "caption": "Figure 14 depicts a magnetic phase diagram for a multilayer superconductor system, showing the relationship between normalized external magnetic field H/Hs and normalized distance x/Î» within the system. The stable Meissner state is found below the blue and red curves, which are calculated from the critical field equations. The crossing points, m and c, designate significant thresholds; m symbolizes the optimal thickness d_m at which the field H achieves its maximum value, while c identifies the critical point where the Meissner state stability is compromised. This diagram illustrates how increasing the thickness of superconducting layers impacts the stability of the Meissner state and the maximum field strength, crucial for designing multilayer systems to enhance their operational field limits.",
