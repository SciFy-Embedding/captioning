      "caption": "The image presents Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) results at the Ta L3 edge to study Ta site occupancy in Nb3Sn post various heat treatments. The graphs illustrate changes in Fourier transform magnitudes (|χ(R)| Å^(-3) ) across temperatures: 634°C, 666°C, and 711°C, revealing a dynamic shift in Ta positions, primarily affecting antisite disorder. Schematic lattice diagrams detail dopant occupancy showing temperature-dependent trends—Ti consistently occupies the Nb site, unlike Ta that switches between Nb and Sn sites depending on temperature. The scientific significance lies in understanding antisite disorder impact on superconducting parameters like *Hc2*, offering insights into tailoring heat treatments for optimal superconducting performance .",

The Fp curves (a) are depicted as functions of applied magnetic field (μ₀H, in Tesla), showing critical current density responses across temperatures. The bottom chart (b) presents Fp normalized by its maximum value and plotted against the field strength relative to HMax, indicative of grain boundary (GB) and point defect (PD) pinning mechanisms with theoretical representations as dashed lines. This analysis reflects the temperature-dependence of Fp in pinning mechanisms, aligning with commercial wire performances and serves to optimize materials for high-field applications .",

The slopes for transitions between 2.188 T/K at 634°C to 2.227 T/K at 666°C and 2.254 T/K at 711°C indicate an increasing trend of *Hc2* with higher temperatures.
