      "caption": "Figure 6 illustrates the normalized shifts in (a) resonant frequencies δf/f₀ and (b) loaded quality factors δQ_L/Q_L as functions of the field misalignment angle ζ (degrees) for a Nb3Sn superconducting resonator. The experimental context involves cycling the magnetic field from 0 to 60 mT and back to zero, measuring resultant changes in the loaded quality factor and frequency to determine the optimal magnet alignment. Notably, both δf(ζ)/f₀ and δQ_L(ζ)/Q_L(0) peak at ζ = 3.8°, suggesting a configuration in which the magnetic field is parallel to the film plane. This behavior is crucial for minimizing trapped vortices and optimizing device performance, confirming field alignment within the experimental setup .",

Data is presented for (a) a magnetic field parallel to the strip (Bkz) and (b) perpendicular (Bky), calculated using mean-field models involving grain boundary orientations at low fields, B₀ = 10 mT. Across various temperatures, the model effectively captures the field-induced effects on resonance frequency shifts observed experimentally. This suggests significant contributions of grain boundaries to the nonlinear Meissner effect (NLME) seen in these polycrystalline superconducting films, providing insights into the field-dependent inductance behavior.",

The graph displays a notably stronger increase in kinetic inductance for B||z as compared to B||y, diverging from the expected behavior observed in Nb coplanar resonators. This observation highlights the impact of grain boundaries, which alter the magnetic field's effect on superconducting kinetics differently from the conventionally predicted models reliant solely on Meissner pairbreaking.",
