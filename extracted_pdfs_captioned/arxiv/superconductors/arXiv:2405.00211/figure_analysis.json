      "caption": "Figure 3 illustrates the evolution of the quality factor and X-ray emissions across varying accelerating field strengths for a Nb3Sn superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavity at two different stages of processing: initial, degraded, and recoated. Panel A shows the initial quality factor reaching a maximum of approximately 2 × 10^10 at 4 K with a peak accelerating field of 24 MV/m. Panel B illustrates the impact of degradation, representing the quality factor decrease to about 1 × 10^10 at 4 K with a peak field reduced to 8 MV/m. Panel C displays the results post-recoating, where the quality factor remains at approximately 1 × 10^10 at 4 K, but the peak field strength improves to 19 MV/m. X-ray emissions, indicated by 'x', are observed at higher field strengths post-recoating, suggesting potential multipacting effects. These findings underscore the impact of both degradation and recoating on the cavity's performance, highlighting the recoating process as a viable method to restore superconductive functionality following mechanical and stress-induced damage.",

      "caption": "Figure 0 depicts temperature maps associated with the cavity's surface before and after the Sn recoating process at an accelerating field of 19 MV/m. The top panel captures the temperature distribution of a degraded cavity, showing localized heating near the equator, which was linked to performance degradation and quench initiation. The lower panel, reflecting after the recoating, reveals a significant decrease in localized heating, indicating successful healing of the primary defect area. The data suggest that recoating with Sn vapor at elevated temperatures can effectively bridge cracks in the Nb3Sn layer, reducing thermal hotspots and improving cavity performance. This observation is crucial to developing cost-effective recoating techniques to sustain the high performance of SRF cavities in particle accelerators.",
