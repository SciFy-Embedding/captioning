      "caption": "Figure 2 shows the upper critical field (Hc2) of Mg^10B_2, determined resistively (with onset and offset marked by vertical bars and maximum slope points as open circles) and also identified via magnetization measurements (filled circles). Asterisks represent the irreversible field (Hirr). This figure underscores the consistency between resistive and magnetization data in determining critical fields, highlighting superconductive characteristics near the critical temperature.",

The inset presents the resulting values of Hc. The behavior close to theoretical predictions by Abrikosov validates this approach and advances understanding of superconducting magnetization behavior.",
