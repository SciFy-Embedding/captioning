      "caption": "Figure 5 depicts the real part of the 3rd harmonics of the AC magnetic susceptibility, χ'₃(T), for a polycrystalline Nb3Sn sample across various DC fields. The measurements capture a temperature-dependent non-linear magnetic response characterized by a singular positive peak at Tc, and minor deviations at lower fields. These responses reveal differences in vortex dynamics compared to single crystals, underscoring the utility of polycrystals in probing subtle superconducting state changes. The findings inform fabrication processes aiming to leverage the predictably of superconducting phases in polycrystalline materials .",

In contrast to single and polycrystalline samples, no Peak Effect is observed here, highlighting the distinct magnetic characteristics of composite wire samples. This is significant as it reflects the uniformity in the critical current distribution across the wire’s filaments, facilitating reliable high-field superconductor applications. The data reveal a consistent magnetic transition without the complex pinning phenomena seen in crystalline forms, indicating potentially stable performance under varied magnetic conditions for multifilamentary superconductors .",

The measurements were performed with an AC magnetic field amplitude of 128 Oe and frequency of 107 Hz. This figure shows the linear response of the magnetic susceptibility, which, in this context, is utilized to identify the presence of the Peak Effect—a significant thermal hysteresis observed above 3 Tesla. This effect manifests as a dip in χ'₁(T) caused by a peak in the critical current density indicating a transition in the vortex structure from a disordered phase to a more ordered Bragg Glass phase. The results enhance understanding of the vortex dynamics and critical phenomena in type-II superconductors like Nb3Sn. This contributes to the broader context of improving performance in superconducting applications by stabilizing the vortex lattice under high magnetic field conditions .",
