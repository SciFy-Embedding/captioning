      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks breadth analysis for highly compressed single crystal La4H23 at a pressure of 95 GPa. Subplots (a-c) display the variable beta_raw(theta) and (d-f) illustrate beta(theta), described as beta_raw(theta) minus instrumental broadening beta_l,upper(theta). Data are fitted to the Williamson-Hall equation with two scenarios: (a,d) both variables are free, (b,e) under a condition of strain (epsilon = 0), and (c,f) under a condition where size approaches infinity (finite strain). This advanced analysis demonstrates a low nanocrystalline strain (~0.005) in the La4H23 phase, corresponding to epitaxial YBa2Cu3O7-δ films, revealing insights into microstructural characteristics under extreme conditions【4:1†temp_paper_173e68fdfe1da8f61ebd83f3e26d5faf.txt】.",
