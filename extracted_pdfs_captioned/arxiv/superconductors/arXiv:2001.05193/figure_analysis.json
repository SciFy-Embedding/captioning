      "caption": "The figure illustrates the temperature-dependent physical properties of A15-type (V0.5Nb0.5)3−xMoxAl0.5Ga0.5 high-entropy alloys (HEAs) focusing on superconductivity within the range x = 0.2 to 1.4. Panel (a) displays the resistivity (ρ/ρ10K) showing a superconducting transition with increasing Mo content. Panel (b) depicts the magnetic susceptibility (4πχZFC) indicating superconducting behavior below certain temperatures (T), whereas panel (c) presents specific heat data as C/T versus T with normal-state fits from Debye model shown as red solid lines. Panel (d) highlights resistivity changes for x = 0.2 under various magnetic fields, with the midpoint of the transition marked for clarity. Panel (e) focuses on upper critical field (Bc2) as a function of temperature, with solid lines fitted using the WHH model. Panel (f) represents the reduced critical temperature ratio Tc/ΘD over the electronic specific heat coefficient (γ), denoting electronic characteristics linked to superconductive transition. Panel (g) illustrates how Tc logarithm changes with the inverted electron-phonon coupling constant, comparing with data for Nb3Sn. Finally, panel (h) shows the Bc2(0)/Tc ratio relative to Mo content, indicating robustness of the superconducting state against external magnetic fields, with comparisons to Nb3Sn and theoretical limits. These measurements underscore the superconducting potential and variation with Mo content in A15-type HEAs.",

      "caption": "This figure consists of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for (V0.5Nb0.5)3−xMoxAl0.5Ga0.5 HEAs presented as-cast (a) and after annealing (b). For as-cast samples with x ≤ 0.4, peaks align with a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure; however, for x ≥ 0.6, the A15 structure dominates. The annealed samples invariably show the A15 structure, with minor impurity peaks, particularly for x ≤ 0.6, marked with asterisks. The inset graph provides lattice parameters of the A15 phase, demonstrating how they change with Mo content, x. This illustrates the phase transformation induced by thermal treatment from bcc to A15, crucial for understanding the HEAs' superconductivity.",

      "caption": "This electron diffraction pattern figure from as-cast and annealed HEAs shows various structural changes. Panel (a) shows the XRD pattern for x = 0.2, indicating a bcc structure, while (b) highlights the annealed form transforming to A15 structure. Panel (c) presents the electron diffraction for the bcc polymorph, characterized by concentric rings, indicative of small grain sizes. In contrast, panel (d) for the A15 phase shows discrete spots, suggesting larger grain growth. Panel (e) exhibits temperature-dependent resistivity for these polymorphs, with the bcc polymorph showing no superconductivity down to 1.8 K, while the A15 shows a transition with notable heat capacity changes, emphasizing the structural implications on superconductivity.",

      "caption": "This figure demonstrates the relationship between superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and valence electron count (VEC) per atom for A15-type (V0.5Nb0.5)3−xMoxAl0.5Ga0.5 HEAs. It compares data to binary A15 and other HEA superconductors. The Tc for the HEAs decreases with increasing VEC, deviating from binary A15 superconductors predicted by Matthias' rule. This highlights the effect of electron count and chemical disorder on superconductivity, providing guidance for tailoring Tc in HEAs.",
