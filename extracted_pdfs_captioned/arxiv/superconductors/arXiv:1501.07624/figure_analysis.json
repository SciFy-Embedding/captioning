      "caption": "Figure 3 shows the cross-sectional design of the elliptical tungsten liner inside the BCS1 8 T dipole, part of the radiation protection system for the Higgs Factory (HF). The liner, with dimensions of 4.1 cm horizontally and 2 cm vertically, surrounds the beam and is configured to be cooled at 60-80 K. Outside the liner, in radial order, are the support structure, stainless steel beam pipe, Kapton insulation, liquid helium channel, and finally, the Nb3Sn coil cooled at 4.5 K. This configuration is part of a larger system designed to protect superconducting magnets from heat and radiation damage, ensuring operational stability and longevity by reducing the peak power density to below the quench limit of the superconducting coils.",

This model integrates the lattice and detector configurations and incorporates a detailed magnetic field map to simulate the effects of radiation and optimize superconducting magnet protection. The design emphasizes a large aperture for SC magnets in the IR to accommodate beam emittance and protect against decay product-induced showers.",

This visualization helps understand the heat management strategies required to maintain the operational efficiency of the cryoplant and manage cryogenic costs. The system successfully achieves an average dynamic heat load below the 10 W/m level acceptable for the system's operational temperature, illustrating the effectiveness of the radiation protection system.",
