The x-axis represents the accelerating field (E_acc) in MV/m, and the y-axis indicates the average surface resistance (⟨Rs⟩) in ohms. The data is visualized using different markers for the top and bottom half cells, with error bars indicating measurement variability. Key findings include a noticeable increase in surface resistance with increasing accelerating field, demonstrating a dependency that is likely influenced by temperature mapping data. Scientifically, this result highlights the impact of accelerating gradients on surface resistance, which is critical for optimizing SRF cavity performance.",
