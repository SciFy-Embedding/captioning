      "caption": "Figure 4 compares the figure of merit B^2Q as a function of the applied magnetic field B for different superconducting materials: YBCO, FeSeTe, Nb3Sn, and NbTi, evaluated at 4 K and 9.08 GHz. The y-axis represents the B^2Q factor on a logarithmic scale, while the x-axis shows the magnetic field B in Tesla. The B^2Q factors are plotted for worst-case (dotted lines, B ⊥ J) and realistic scenarios (continuous lines, taking α-angular coefficient into account). Copper (Cu) is used as a reference (star symbols). YBCO and FeSeTe outperform Cu even in the worst-case, while under realistic conditions, all studied superconductors show superior performance relative to Cu. The enhancement in B^2Q factor signifies improved haloscope sensitivity for axion detection.",

      "caption": "Figure 2 presents the pinning constant k_p as a function of reduced temperature t = T / Tc for YBCO (orange circles) and FeSeTe (blue squares) under a magnetic field of 5 T in zero field cooling (ZFC) condition, plotted in panel a. In panel b, the field dependence of k_p is shown for Nb3Sn (green triangles), YBCO, and FeSeTe at lower temperatures. The fitting model indicates the pinning regime involves strong pinning for YBCO, while FeSeTe and Nb3Sn exhibit a collective pinning regime. These data are critical in understanding the vortex behavior and optimally tuning the superconductor for higher B^2Q values in haloscope applications to enhance dark matter detection sensitivity.",

The y-axis represents η on a logarithmic scale, indicating the energy dissipation related to vortex motion. Empty square symbols denote extrapolated points at 4 K. Nb3Sn and NbTi curves (green and red, respectively) are obtained by considering η from flux-flow resistivity models. The analysis of η is crucial for evaluating how different superconducting materials can sustain the operational conditions in haloscopes, contributing to enhancing the Q-factor crucial for detecting axion-like particles.",

The continuous and dashed lines represent realistic and worst-case scenario calculations considering angular coefficients. Star symbols indicate B^2Q values for Cu cavities. YBCO maintains high sensitivity across frequencies, making it optimal for broad-spectrum haloscope applications, while NbTi becomes inefficient at higher frequencies. FeSeTe shows potential for improvement due to its intrinsic properties, offering competitive performance with further material optimization.",

Visualized are the electric field (E-field) in blue, magnetic field (H-field) in black, and surface current density (J_s) in red. The direction of an externally applied static magnetic field is parallel to the cavity's longitudinal axis. This simulation underscores the interaction dynamics between applied fields and the superconductive walls, providing insights into optimizing the haloscope design to maximize detection sensitivity of axion signals by influencing cavity Q-factors.",
