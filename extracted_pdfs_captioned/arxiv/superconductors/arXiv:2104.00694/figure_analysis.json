      "caption": "Figure 4 illustrates the temperature-dependent behavior of a 200 nm V3Si layer during in-situ XRD experiments. In subplot (a), the evolution of stress with annealing temperature is presented for both sapphire and silicon substrates, highlighting the role of thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) mismatch in stress development. Subplot (b) shows the cooling strain behavior of the V3Si layer, emphasizing linear recovery due to thermoelastic stress. Subplots (c) and (d) represent the variation in integral breadth for out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions, respectively, of the V3Si (210) peak. This indicates crystallite size modifications, with significant growth observed up to 860 °C, elucidating anisotropic grain growth facilitated by substrates' mechanical influence. The figure underscores the interplay between temperature, stress relaxation, and grain growth in optimizing V3Si properties for potential superconducting applications.",

The figure includes two different substrate conditions: a thermal oxide-coated silicon substrate (top) and HF-cleaned silicon (bottom). The emergence of a VSi2 layer, indicated by distinct morphology changes, is visible at the Si/V3Si interface for HF-cleaned samples, emphasizing substrate surface treatment significance in silicide phase development and the competitive growth between V3Si and VSi2.",
