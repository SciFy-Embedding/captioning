      "caption": "Figure 5 illustrates the periodic structure of the differential conductance (dV/dI) characteristic of a YBaSrCuO-Ag contact with a resistance R^N of approximately 105 Ω, captured at temperatures of 10 K (curve 1) and 20 K (curve 2). This graph provides insights into the superconducting phase behavior with varied dV/dI peaks indicating changes in the contact's resistance properties at different temperatures. The periodicity and peak shifts in response to temperature alterations indicate the dynamic interaction of superconducting phases at the interface, essential for understanding superconducting junctions and their thermal dependence .",

The curve is characterized by step-like features, typical of superconducting junctions in nonequilibrium states. The dot-and-dash line signifies the parallel line to IVC for large voltage values. These steps are indicative of phase slip centers that form under nonequilibrium conditions in superconductors, an essential feature for applications in quantum computing and nanoscale electronic devices .",

Marked by distinct steps, the IVC showcases discrete differential resistance values of 60, 117, 150, and 170 Ω, indicative of abrupt transitions between superconducting phases. These profiles are marked with tangents facilitating the determination of resistance values at the phase transitions, crucial for understanding the finely tunable electrical properties of superconductor-metal junctions in specific temperature conditions .",
