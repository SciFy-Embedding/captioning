      "caption": "Figure 0 shows a comparative analysis of Nb3Sn coatings on niobium substrates using plane-view SEM and cross-sectional HAADF-STEM images. The SEM images demonstrate two types of coatings: a matte coating, which is approximately 2 µm thick and features larger grains, and a shiny coating that is thinner at about 1 µm with smaller grain diameters. This distinction in thickness and grain size is directly correlated with differences in surface roughness and superconducting performance. The HAADF-STEM images reveal structural variations, showing distinct layers and grain boundaries. The findings indicate that thinner coatings with smaller grains, as seen in the shiny Nb3Sn, contribute to reduced surface roughness and potentially better superconducting properties by minimizing flux entry.",
