The perturbation theory is valid for -0.5 < J/U < 0, where no level crossing occurs. It is noted that for J > 0, the ground state converges to a total spin S = 3/2 configuration, contrasting with J < 0 configurations. This demonstrates the influence of Hund's coupling on the spin state hierarchy and the coupling constants' role in stabilizing different spin-orbit coupling behaviors as a function of J/U .",
