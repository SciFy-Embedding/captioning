      "caption": "Figure 10: This figure illustrates the part of the magnetic phase diagram of a Nb3Sn single crystal, derived from the resistivity and dc magnetization data. Filled circles indicate the upper critical field, while open circles and squares correspond to Tp and the center of the peak-effect region from magnetization data, respectively. The inset depicts the magnetic-field dependence of the width of the peak-effect region (∆H), which is calculated from both resistivity and magnetization data. This diagram confirms the presence of the peak effect and supports interpretations regarding spatial pinning variations in the superconductor. The demonstration of peak regions bolster the understanding of superconductivity behavior near transition thresholds .",

Different shaking frequencies range from 5 Hz to 5 kHz. The results imply that significant resistivity below the critical temperature emerges predominantly at frequencies above 1 kHz, indicating a threshold frequency where the peak effect on resistivity becomes measurable. The frequency dependence highlights dynamic behavior in low-temperature superconductors .",

In this setup, the peak effect is prominently visible below the critical temperature, T<sub>c</sub>, evidenced by finite resistance measurements attributed to the movement of magnetic vortices.
