      "caption": "Figure 5 shows the irreversibility field (H_Irr) as a function of temperature for different monofilament wires. The data indicates that the H_Irr of the Ta-Hf doped monofilament is the highest among the tested samples. The addition of SnO2 to Zr and Hf monofilaments results in degraded H_Irr values. The inset reveals the unreacted monofilament architecture featuring a Ta-coated Nb alloy rod, surrounded by Cu stabilization. This figure supports the finding that Nb4Ta1Hf alloy enhances vortex pinning and superconducting properties compared to Nb4Ta1Zr, especially in the presence of internal oxidation (SnO2 addition).",

The data demonstrates an enhancement in pinning force density for Nb-Ta-Zr and Nb-Ta-Hf conductors, with peak pinning force density occurring at higher fields compared to a standard Ta-doped conductor. This highlights the effectiveness of Zr and Hf additions in improving vortex pinning efficiency, which is critical for applications requiring high magnetic fields.",
