      "caption": "The image depicts the cross-section of a BiSCO round composite wire on the left and a BiSCO Rutherford cable on the right. The cross-section of the BiSCO round composite wire illustrates the uniform arrangement of superconducting filaments within the wire, which are critical for achieving high current densities essential for superconducting magnets used in high-energy physics. On the right, the cross-section of the Rutherford cable demonstrates the flat arrangement of superconducting filaments, optimized for incorporation into electromagnets. The BiSCO wire uses a high-temperature superconductor, ideal for creating cable geometries necessary for accelerator magnets due to its flexibility and capacity to handle high electromagnetic forces without degrading. These images underscore the importance of engineered wire and cable structures in enhancing superconducting properties, minimizing porosity, and optimizing Jc (critical current density) for applications in high-field magnets. These designs aim to address and improve BiSCO wire performance issues related to strain and stress, thus advancing the development of magnet-ready superconductors essential for large-scale high-energy physics facilities.",
