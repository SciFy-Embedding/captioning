      "caption": "This figure shows the DC resistance test of a Nb3Sn film sample, indicating a transition temperature (*Tc0*) of 17.5 K. The resistance is plotted on the y-axis in micro-ohms (µΩ) against the temperature on the x-axis in Kelvin (K). The superconducting transition is marked by a sharp decline in resistance around 17.5 K, demonstrating the successful creation of superconducting Nb3Sn with a comparatively high critical temperature. This result is significant as it confirms the high-quality superconducting phase essential for future applications in superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities.",
