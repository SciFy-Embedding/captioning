      "caption": "Figure 3 illustrates the temperature dependence of the ac magnetic susceptibility (χ_ac) for the solid solution Nb₅Ir₃−xPtxO with varying x compositions, specifically x=0.0, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.6 in part (a), and x=1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.6, 2.8, and 3.0 in part (b). The susceptibility is plotted in arbitrary units against temperature in Kelvin (K). The data demonstrate a superconducting transition, characterized by a sudden change in the susceptibility, whose onset shifts with varying x. Notably, the transition temperature (T_c) decreases as x approaches and exceeds 0.6. This observation aligns with measurements indicating robust superconductivity in the parent compound Nb₅Ir₃O, which decreases with Pt substitution. The results are significant as they provide insights into the superconductivity of the Ti₅Ga₄-type Nb₅Ir₃O series.",

      "caption": "Figure 4 presents the temperature dependence of resistivity (ρ), normalized to its room temperature value, for Nb₅Ir₃−xPtxO at different compositions: x=0.0, 0.6, 1.6, 2.2, 2.6, and 3.0. Part (a) shows the low-temperature region, while part (b) covers the broader range from 2.8 K to 300 K. The resistivity curves exhibit deviations from linearity above the superconducting transition temperature T_c, attributed to additional scattering mechanisms. The study applies a fitting model with residual and phonon scattering terms, showcasing the complex interplay of structural and electronic factors with the Pt substitution. These findings are critical for understanding the electronic transport properties in the context of A15-type superconductors.",
