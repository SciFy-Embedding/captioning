      "caption": "The figure represents the total and partial electronic density of states (DOS) for the Nb3Au intermetallic compound as a function of energy. The top panel shows the total DOS, while the bottom panels display the projected DOS (PDOS) for Nb and Au contributions. Energy (in eV) is plotted on the x-axis, and density of states per unit cell (in states/eV/unit cell) is on the y-axis. The Fermi level is positioned at 0 eV, indicated by a vertical dashed line. Key findings include the dominance of 4d orbitals of Nb at the Fermi level, suggesting that these states are crucial for the electrical conductivity of Nb3Au. The DOS analysis reveals no band gap at the Fermi level, confirming the metallic nature of Nb3Au. The scientific significance lies in understanding the electronic structure contributions to the compound's properties, such as stability, which is inferred from the DOS profile at the Fermi level .",
