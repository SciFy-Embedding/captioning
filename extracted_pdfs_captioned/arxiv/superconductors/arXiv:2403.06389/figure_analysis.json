      "caption": "Figure 10 illustrates the suppression of flux jumps in superconductor (SC) wires, comparing three configurations: bare Nb3Sn wire (SC), Nb3Sn wire with a copper layer (SC/Cu), and Nb3Sn wire with a ferromagnetic (FM) layer (SC/FM). Part (a) shows the number of flux jumps as a function of frequency (f) for an AC magnetic field with an amplitude fixed at Ba^0 = 0.75 T, demonstrating that the FM layer effectively eliminates flux jumps across all frequencies, while jumps are observed in SC and SC/Cu wires. Parts (b) and (c) plot temperature evolutions for f = 0.5 Hz and 10 Hz, respectively, revealing higher temperature ranges in SC and SC/Cu wires compared to SC/FM, suggesting FM's superior thermal management. Part (d) shows the effect of the magnetic field amplitude on flux jumps at a fixed frequency of 0.5 Hz, where flux jumps begin to occur in SC and SC/Cu wires above 0.3 T, but not until higher amplitudes in SC/FM wires. These findings support the FM layer's role in enhancing thermal stability and suppressing unwanted magnetic instabilities.",

The left panels present results at a low magnetic field (Ba = 0.2 T) and the right panels at a high field (Ba = 3.0 T). At low fields, the FM layer effectively shields magnetic flux and reduces current density within the superconducting core, demonstrating its magnetic shielding capacity. This shielding effect diminishes at higher fields, where the FM material's permeability decreases due to approaching saturation. These results highlight the FM layer's role in enhancing the thermomagnetic stability through magnetic shielding, significantly at low field conditions.",
