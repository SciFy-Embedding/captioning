      "caption": "Figure 6 illustrates the variation in upper critical field (μ₀Hc2) and critical temperature (Tc) of Nb₃Sn superconductors as a function of heat treatment time, at a fixed temperature of 12 K. The y-axis on the left represents the upper critical field in Tesla, while the right y-axis shows the critical temperature in Kelvin. The x-axis denotes the heat treatment time in hours. The figure uses data from Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) and SQUID measurements to provide insights into changes in μ₀Hc2 and Tc over time. The results indicate that extended heat treatment enhances the critical properties, with 10-90% of Tc (0) showing drastic improvements. The data signifies that optimizing heat treatment can significantly enhance superconducting properties, crucial for applications needing high magnetic fields.",

The graphs showcase curves for different resistance-to-normal state transition percentages (10%, 90%, etc.), illustrating how longer heat treatments enhance superconducting properties by narrowing critical transition widths. The figure reinforces the concept that increased annealing time improves A15 phase crystallinity and enhances superconductor performance by reducing the μ₀Hc2 transition width significantly.",
