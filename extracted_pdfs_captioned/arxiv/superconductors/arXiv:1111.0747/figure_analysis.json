      "caption": "Figure 6: Residual strains of Nb3Al filament in sample C derived from single-peak and multi-peak analyses along the axial direction. The vertical axis represents the calculated residual strain percentage (ε, %), while the horizontal bars for 211, 320, 321 single peak, and multi-peak analyses show sequential measurements (1st to 4th). The dashed line indicates the average residual strain of the four measurements, quantified respectively as 0.051%, 0.035%, 0.011%, and 0.045%. Error bars represent the standard deviation, demonstrating a higher precision in multi-peak over single-peak analysis, indicative of the multi-peak method's ability to yield macroscopic residual strain values with improved statistical reliability, important for applications requiring precise stress-strain characterization.",
