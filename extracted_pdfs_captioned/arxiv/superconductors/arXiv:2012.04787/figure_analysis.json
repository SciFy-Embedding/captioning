Panel (b) depicts the patterns for *Imm*2-YH7 and *Cmcm*-LaH3 phases within DAC M1, highlighting the structural and compositional analysis required for accurate phase identification under high pressures. Panel (c) illustrates a fragment of the (La,Y)H10 crystal structure where Y and La atoms are neighbors, which aids in visualizing the atomic arrangements within the lattice. Panel (d) shows a pressure versus unit cell volume diagram for fcc LaH10, overlaying experimental data with theoretical calculations to elucidate the effects of pressure on structural properties. Lastly, panel (e) provides estimates of Y content in (La,Y)H10 and (La,Y)H6 derived from experimental unit cell volumes, illustrating compositional variations and their significance for understanding material properties at elevated pressures .",
