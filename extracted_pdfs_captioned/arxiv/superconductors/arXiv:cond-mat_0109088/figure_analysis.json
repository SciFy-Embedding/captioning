      "caption": "This figure illustrates the transport critical current density (Jc) as a function of the magnetic field (μ0H) for various Nb3Al and Nb3(Al,Ge) superconductors. The x-axis represents the magnetic field up to approximately 14 Tesla, and the y-axis shows Jc in units of A cm⁻². The data points correspond to different processing techniques and alloy compositions as indicated in the legend. Noticeable is the peak in Jc just before reaching the upper critical field Hc2 for the Nb3(Al,Ge) alloy, indicating optimization potential for high-field applications. This trend is significant for improving the utility of Nb3Al-based superconductors in applications like NMR magnets, where achieving high Jc at high magnetic fields is crucial. The data emphasize the impact of alloying and processing conditions on the superconducting properties, thereby highlighting the scope for further research and development in high-performance superconducting materials.",

      "caption": "The schematic diagram details the experimental setup for the direct electrochemical reduction process in molten CaCl2, used to reduce Nb-O and Ti-O rods. Key components in the diagram include a graphite anode and a specialized rod composed of Nb-O and Ti-O supported by a Kanthal support immersed in molten CaCl2 within a crucible. This setup is fundamental to the Direct Electrochemical Reduction of Oxides (DERO) process, aimed at producing low-cost, multifilamentary superconducting conductors by simplifying the extraction and alloying of niobium-based intermetallic compounds, thereby offering cost efficiencies in the production of superconducting materials.",

      "caption": "The graph presents AC susceptibility measurements across various Nb-based metallic rods. The x-axis represents temperature in Kelvin while the y-axis is labeled with AC susceptibility in arbitrary units. Different data series reflect distinct compositions, including pure Nb, Nb-Ti, and Nb3Sn, processed by the DERO technique. The results highlight variations in superconducting transitions as evidenced by the differing onset temperatures of superconductivity, particularly the improved AC susceptibility of Nb3Sn, notably marked by shifts observed at reduction temperatures (*Tr*) of 800 and 900 degrees respectively. These findings are key to understanding the role of processing temperatures in optimizing superconducting properties, essential for enhancing the functionality of materials used in high-field applications.",
