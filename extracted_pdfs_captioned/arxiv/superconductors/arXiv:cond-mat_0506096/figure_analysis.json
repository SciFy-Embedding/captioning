      "caption": "Figure 4 illustrates the correlation between the total reduction in vortex core area and the electronic thermal conductivity (**κᵉ**) in the superconductors V3Si and NbSe₂. The left axis (solid squares) shows the reduced core area, while the right axis (open triangles) displays the electronic thermal conductivity. The data is plotted against (Hᶜ²(0)/H)¹/², which is proportional to the intervortex spacing. Both quantities are normalized to their high-field values, with the V3Si data shifted upward for clarity. The figure highlights that both V3Si and NbSe₂ exhibit similar field dependence due to the delocalization of quasiparticles (QPs), as evidenced by the consistent reduction in core size and increase in κᵉ with increasing field. This supports the hypothesis of a common underlying mechanism in single-band and multi-band superconductors.",

      "caption": "Figure 2 presents the field dependence of the vortex core size (ξᵃᵇ) and the electronic thermal conductivity (κᵉ/κⁿ) in NbSe₂ at T = 20 mK. The plot displays ξᵃᵇ (squares) and κᵉ normalized to its normal-state value κⁿ (circles) with magnetic field H. The dashed lines are guides for the eye and suggest a rapid reduction in core size accompanied by an increase in κᵉ up to 4 kOe. Above 4 kOe, ξᵃᵇ saturates, indicating increased localization of QPs in the vortex cores, while κᵉ continues to increase due to the rising number of vortices. This behavior corroborates the multi-band superconductivity characteristics and the influence of distinct energy gaps in NbSe₂.",

      "caption": "Figure 3 examines the field dependence of the magnetic penetration depth (λᵃᵇ) in NbSe₂ at T = 20 mK. The data indicates a significant increase in λᵃᵇ at low magnetic fields, which weakens at higher fields. This behavior suggests the presence of delocalized QP states that affect current density around the vortex cores, rather than being attributable to the Volovik effect. The increase in λᵃᵇ correlates with the delocalization process of QPs, further supporting the unique characteristics of NbSe₂ as a multi-band superconductor.",

      "caption": "Figure 1 shows the Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) of the time dependence of muon spin polarization in NbSe₂ at T = 20 mK and H = 4 kOe (open circles). The solid curve represents the fit to the Ginzburg-Landau model's spatial field profile equation. This FFT analysis closely resembles the expected vortex lattice field distribution, n(B), for a hexagonal vortex lattice. The inset provides the muon spin precession signal and its corresponding fit, in a rotating reference frame. This figure supports the experimental technique's reliability in capturing the nuanced features of the internal magnetic field distribution, crucial for analyzing vortex core size in multi-band superconductors like NbSe₂.",
