      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates the temperature dependence of resistivity (ρ) for the Nb10+2xMo35−xRu35−xRh10Pd10 high-entropy alloys (HEAs) in panel (a), showing data in high and zero magnetic fields for x = 2.5. The resistivity decreases with increasing Nb content, indicative of disorder influence. Panel (b) presents the temperature dependence of the upper critical field Bc2(T) for x = 0, 2.5, and 5. The upper critical field values are fitted using the WHH model, depicting a non-linear decrease consistent with the applied magnetic field. These findings highlight the influence of Nb content on superconductivity, with the highest Bc2(0) observed at x = 5 indicating strong magnetoresistance suppression in this alloy system .",

      "caption": "Figure 4 displays the valence electron concentration (VEC) dependence of the critical temperature (Tc) among different hexagonal HEA superconductors, including the Nb-Mo-Ru-Rh-Pd system studied in this work, compared against crystalline 4d metals and Tc-based binary alloys. A general downward trend in Tc with increasing VEC is observed, suggesting conforming behavior to Matthias’s rule. This comparative contextualization emphasizes the tunability of Tc in relation to valence electron adjustments in HEA systems .",

(b) displays energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping for x = 2.5, revealing uniform element distribution. Panels (c)-(e) present structural refinement profiles for x = 0, 2.5, and 5, with refinement parameters such as Rwp, Rp, and goodness-of-fit (GOF) indicating strong agreement with theoretical models. This figure underscores the structural consistency and elemental homogeneity within these HEAs .",

Panels (b) and (c) detail zero-field cooling and field cooling magnetic susceptibilities, and specific heat measurements fitted by the Debye model, respectively. These experimental observations confirm bulk superconductivity across compositions, with a clear differentiation in Tc among different x values, showcasing the complex interplay between elemental composition and superconducting properties .",
