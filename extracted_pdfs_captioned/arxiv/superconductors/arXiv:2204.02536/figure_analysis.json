      "caption": "The TFSRF for HEP Roadmap illustrates the planned technological advancements and research timelines from 2022 to 2030 for improving superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) surfaces, particularly in high energy physics (HEP). Major milestones include the establishment of niobium (Nb) thin film baselines, integration of Nb/Cu technology, exploration of new SRF films, and development of adequate SRF substrates and preparation methods. This roadmap also emphasizes the use of cryogenic materials like nitrogen (N) doped surfaces and cryo-modulation to improve SRF surface resistance and efficiency. The figure signifies strategic steps towards enhancing particle accelerator capabilities, reducing operational costs through advanced material applications, sustaining very high gradients, and maintaining economic viability for future high-energy physics applications.",

      "caption": "This figure presents a comparative view of current and future SRF cavity design concepts. On the left, the 'Today' side illustrates a traditional RF cavity with a natural oxide layer not stable above 150Â°C, optimized primarily for thermal transfer involving high residual resistance ratio (RRR) Nb. To the right, the 'Future' side proposes a multi-layered cavity structure including a protective layer for reduced Kapitza resistance, an 'RF' layer optimized for superconductivity with low surface resistance, and intermediate layers for structure, thermal conduction, and thermal transfer. The future design aims to enhance superconducting properties, minimize thermal resistance, and protect against environmental degradation, reflecting on the ongoing innovations in layered superconductor structures to improve overall SRF performance.",
