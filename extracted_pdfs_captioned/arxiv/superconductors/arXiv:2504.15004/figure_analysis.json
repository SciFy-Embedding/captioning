      "caption": "Figure 1 presents the resistance-temperature data for BaH12 under 100 GPa pressure during heating #1 as measured by Chen et al. (2021) . The top panel (a) shows the raw resistance data (R(T)) along with a fit to the Bloch-Grüneisen model, indicating an onset superconducting transition temperature, Tc, of 8.3 K. The bottom panel (b) provides a fit to the Einstein model, confirming a consistent Tc onset. Derived parameters such as Debye temperature (ΘD = 349 ± 1 K) and electron-phonon coupling (λe-ph,D = 0.709) align with these models. The ratio ΘE/ΘD = 0.805 is noted, lower than the theoretical value of 0.828. These findings contribute to understanding electron-phonon interactions in this superconducting material.",

The derived parameters—U, V, and W—are displayed, with W indicating a value of (1.29 ± 0.06) ×10^-6, and both U and V being zero. The measured βinst(θ) values are shown across various Bragg angles, with a fit aligning closely within a 95% confidence band. This instrumental calibration is essential for accurate peak breadth determination in further diffraction studies.",

Similar to heating #1, raw data is plotted with fits to both Bloch-Grüneisen and Einstein models, yielding a second Tc onset at 7.0 K. Debye temperature and electron-phonon coupling are slightly lower than heating #1, with λe-ph,D = 0.69. The Einstein-to-Debye temperature ratio is calculated to be 0.806, reinforcing the results from the initial sample and further asserting BaH12's superconductive characteristics under high-pressure conditions.",

The panels outline raw data fitted with Bloch-Grüneisen and Einstein models (top and bottom respectively), indicating a transition onset at Tc = 86.2 K. Parameters extracted include substantially higher Debye temperature (ΘD = 493 ± 3 K) and notably increased electron-phonon coupling (λe-ph,D = 2.89), alongside the Einstein-Debye ratio maintaining a value of 0.822. This aligns with theoretical predictions and underscores BiH4's robust superconducting potential under extreme pressure.",
