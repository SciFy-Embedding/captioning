      "caption": "This figure presents the specific heat capacity (C/T) as a function of temperature (T) for annealed and unannealed Nb3Si samples labeled 'Recovery 20'. The plot covers temperatures from 0 to 25 K, capturing the superconducting transition. Red circles indicate data for unannealed samples, while blue triangles represent annealed samples. The key finding is a noticeable decrease in the heat capacity anomaly at the transition temperature (Tc) for the annealed sample relative to the unannealed sample, where the anomaly size is reduced by 65%. This demonstrates that annealing impacts the superconducting properties significantly by reducing the Nb content from about 16% to 5% in the sample after annealing .",

The resistivity is plotted against temperature, with data from 83 GPa, 105 GPa, and 120 GPa. The figure highlights that no superconducting transition indicative of the A15 Nb3Si structure is apparent during the unloading process at these pressures, underscoring that high temperatures (~1000Â°C) during initial compression are required for such a phase transition.",

      "caption": "The figure shows the C/T as a function of temperature for annealed and unannealed Nb3Si from 'Recovery 20', emphasizing data around 9 K. The vertical lines indicate the onset of superconductivity related to the bcc Nb phase inherent in the high-pressure compressed sample. Notably, this data is used to determine that the fraction of Nb in the unannealed sample was 16%, decreasing to 5% post annealing. This suggests significant conversion or phase change due to annealing, impacting the material's superconducting properties .",

The data were calculated using density functional theory, aimed at understanding structural stability under pressure. The results demonstrate that the A15 structure becomes the lowest enthalpy, and thus most stable, configuration above 50 GPa. This reinforces the experimental observation that high pressure stabilizes the A15 phase over the tetragonal form, which becomes evident particularly above 50 GPa.",

      "caption": "This figure displays resistivity as a function of temperature for A15 Nb3Si across several pressures from 2 GPa to 88 GPa. The data reveal two characteristic transitions at higher pressures, related to different phases present in the material. The primary transition is attributed to the A15 superconducting phase, while a secondary, higher temperature transition emerges due to a Nb impurity phase. This illustrates the method used to distinguish superconducting transitions of the matrix from those of impurity phases.",

The data highlight that while unloading pressure from 120 GPa on the tetragonal sample led to gasket failure below 70 GPa, the A15 sample managed stable decompression to low pressures. The figure underscores experimental challenges in handling high-pressure conditions and the metastability of these materials.",
