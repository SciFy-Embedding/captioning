      "caption": "Figure 1 shows the detection of the A-15 structure in X-ray diffraction for the La4H23 phase. Panel (a) represents Rietveld and Le Bail refinements against observed XRD patterns for La4H23, where the solid red and grey lines correspond to these refinements. Data between 11° to 13° is interfered by residual elemental lanthanum (Fmmm phase) and gold (Fm3m phase), indicated by intense peaks arising from electrodes and no expected La4H23 reflections. Panel (b) displays an azimuthal 'cake' representation of the XRD detector image in grayscale, indicating the presence of high-intensity reflections as white vertical lines, confirming the sample’s polycrystalline nature. Panel (c) depicts the unit cell volume as a function of pressure for the La4H23 phase, including data from this study and previous reports, supporting the A15 clathrate structure (shown in the inset created with Vesta software). This structure supports the high hydrogen content and the distinctive lattice parameters reflective of the high-temperature superconducting characteristics of La4H23 .",
