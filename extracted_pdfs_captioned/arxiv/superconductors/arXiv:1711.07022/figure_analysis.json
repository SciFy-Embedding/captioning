      "caption": "Figure 9 depicts the temperature dependence of the Poisson's ratio for Ti6Al4V pole wedge and steel 316LN as calculated from Young's and shear moduli. The graph uses a linear fit to show variations across temperatures ranging from 0°C to 700°C. The Poisson's ratio equations are V_DISCUP = -0.0000714 × T + 0.316 for DISCUP and V_316LN = -0.0000572 × T + 0.287 for 316LN. This demonstrates how intrinsic strain response of these materials is temperature sensitive which is critical for understanding and optimizing coil component behavior during the heat treatments involved in Nb3Sn superconducting magnet manufacturing.",
