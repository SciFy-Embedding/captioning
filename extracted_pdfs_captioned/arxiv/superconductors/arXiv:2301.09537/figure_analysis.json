      "caption": "The figure depicts a simulation of the azimuthal stress distribution in a superconducting coil and structural parts during the assembly process using the MQXF quadrant-by-quadrant strategy, as compared to the new symmetric procedure. The top part of the image shows the stress state when bladders are inflated before key insertion, and the bottom shows results after key insertion. The plotted stress values, shown in the center of each image with units in MPa, represent both peak and average stresses. This simulation demonstrates how the symmetric procedure leads to a more uniform stress distribution by reducing peak stresses during the assembly, supporting the methodology’s validity for reducing mechanical risks in superconducting magnets. Technically, this offers a refined approach to improve mechanical stability and performance in high-field superconducting applications.",
