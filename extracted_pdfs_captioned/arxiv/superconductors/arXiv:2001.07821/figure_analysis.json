      "caption": "Figure 4 illustrates the power dissipation as a function of temperature for the 650 MHz Nb3Sn single-cell cavity compared with the PT420 cryocooler load curve. The graph plots dissipated power in watts (on the y-axis) against temperature in Kelvin (on the x-axis), with notable continuous wave (cw) gradients identified through conduction cooling. These notable gradients include 3.4 MV/m at approximately 4.4 K (limited by cooling capacity) and 6.6 MV/m at around 7.2 K (constrained by RF power). The need for a quality factor (Q⁰) of approximately 3x10¹⁰ at 4.4 K to reach 10 MV/m with conduction cooling is highlighted, while an improved Nb3Sn coating has recently met this requirement. The cryocooler load curve divides the plot into operable and non-operable regions for cw use, due to heat dissipation capacity limits. The results demonstrate the practicality of using a single-cell cavity and one cryocooler for certain applications, such as industrial flue gas treatment.",

      "caption": "Figure 2 presents the cavity quality factor (Q⁰) versus accelerating gradient (Eacc) for a 650 MHz Nb3Sn-coated single-cell niobium SRF cavity. Data points show the results of three tests: Test 1 using liquid helium (2 mG magnetic field), and Tests 2 and 3 using cryocooler conduction cooling (with varying magnetic fields). The color scale indicates cavity temperature, ranging from 4 K to 7 K. Tests 2 and 3 demonstrate improvements achieved by reducing magnetic fields and were conducted in environments with higher magnetic contamination, displaying reduced Q⁰ in comparison to Test 1. The results underscore the impact of environmental factors such as magnetic fields and cooling methods on cavity performance.",

The simulation applies a thermal boundary condition of 7.2 K at the conduction ring faces and 4 W of RF heat on the cavity's inner surface. The minor temperature difference between conduction ring and cavity iris (approximately 0.15 K) indicates excellent thermal distribution and cooling, maintaining temperatures well below the Nb3Sn superconducting transition temperature, thus validating the conduction-cooling technique's effectiveness.",
