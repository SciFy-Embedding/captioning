      "caption": "Figure 1 depicts the relationship between the π-band energy gap (Δπ(0)) and resistivity (ρ<sub>0</sub>) in MgB2 thin films, with data points representing different orientations (random, c-axis, epitaxial). The y-axis indicates the energy gap in meV, while the x-axis shows resistivity in μΩ·cm. The solid line in the inset illustrates the small gap change with T<sub>c</sub>, based on interband impurity scattering theory, assuming that Δπ(0)/Δσ(0) = 0.28. The main finding is the monotonous increase of Δπ(0) with ρ<sub>0</sub>, reflecting the two-gap nature of MgB2, where increasing ρ<sub>0</sub> leads to increased interband impurity scattering, equalizing the gap sizes.",

It compares MgB2 films with other superconductors like YBCO, NbN, and Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn, highlighting the lower R<sub>s</sub> of MgB2 within 10-15 K. Different symbols represent different orientations and materials (random, c-axis, epitaxial, and various substrates). The key insight is MgB2's competitive surface resistance at higher working temperatures, beneficial for microwave applications due to efficiency and cost-effectiveness.",

Variety in symbols indicates different film orientations (random, c-axis, epitaxial). The solid line represents a fit based on BCS theory, yielding a London penetration depth (λ<sub>L</sub>) of 33.6 nm. In the inset, λ(0) exhibits a linear relationship with √(1 + α), supporting the BCS model fit. This correlation suggests excellent structural properties for MgB2 films, critical for high-frequency electronic applications.",
