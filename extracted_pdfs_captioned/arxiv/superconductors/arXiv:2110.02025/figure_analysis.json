      "caption": "Figure 7 illustrates the evolution of the charge-density wave (CDW) transition temperature, TCDW, and the superconducting transition temperature, Tc, in different stoichiometric compounds (Sr3Ir4Sn13, Sr3Rh4Sn13, Ca3Ir4Sn13, and Ca3Rh4Sn13) as a function of induced disorder, quantified by defects per formula unit (dpf). Panel (a) shows how TCDW is progressively suppressed with increasing disorder, demonstrating that while CDW is consistently suppressed at a similar rate across different compositions, the suppression rate is notably higher near the quantum critical point, particularly in Ca3Ir4Sn13. Panel (b) reveals a complex behavior where the suppression of T<sub>c</sub> also varies with disorder; notably, there is a significant T<sub>c</sub> increase in some samples when CDW and superconductivity compete. This figure highlights the intricate interplay between CDW and superconductivity in these materials, with key implications for understanding superconducting pairing mechanisms .",
