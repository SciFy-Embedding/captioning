      "caption": "Figure 5 presents atomically resolved HR-STEM images of [12̅0]-tilt grain boundaries (GBs) in Nb3Sn with varying tilt angles: (a) 4.7° with a normal to the GB plane as [001], (b) 17.5° with a GB plane normal [215]. In both micrographs, the Gibbsian interfacial excesses of Sn (ГSn) are plotted as a function of GB disorientation angle in (c). Red squares denote [12̅0] rotation axes at different angles, with the black squares for random rotation axes. The transmission-EBSD color map inset helped determine disorientation angles. Key findings indicate no clear correlation between disorientation angles and Sn segregation, shedding light on factors affecting Sn excess at GBs.",

Each data point is a distinct coat, averaging Sn segregation impacts across 1 to 3 GBs. Part (b) features HAADF-STEM images and Sn L-maps of partially Sn-deficient Nb3Sn grains, showing Sn segregation at GBs where grain interiors are <25% Sn at a GB, validated by a noticeable Sn excess in the EDS profile. This demonstrates significant Sn-atom drift affecting accurate measurement of Sn profiles, revealing larger Sn segregated regions in some cases.",
