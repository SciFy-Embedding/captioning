      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates the crystal structures of V3Ga in two phases: D0₃ Heusler phase (left) and A15 superconductor phase (right). The D0₃ phase features a G-type antiferromagnetism with vanadium (V) and gallium (Ga) atoms arranged in a highly symmetric cubic structure, while the A15 phase displays a different coordination, associated with its superconducting properties. These structural differences underlie the varying physical properties and applications, highlighting the dual-phase nature and its significance in understanding the magnetic and superconducting behaviors within V3Ga systems.",
