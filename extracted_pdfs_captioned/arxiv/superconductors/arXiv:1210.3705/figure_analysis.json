      "caption": "Figure 4 illustrates the effect of applied uniaxial strain on (a) the superconducting critical temperature, T_c; (b) the electron-phonon coupling constant, λ; and (c) the logarithmically averaged phonon frequency, ω_ln. Each parameter shows a characteristic parabolic behavior with respect to strain, peaking at zero strain. This indicates that the superconducting properties of Nb3Sn are highly sensitive to strain, which is significant for understanding strain effects in practical superconducting applications, particularly in multi-filamentary Nb3Sn wires where strain optimization can enhance critical performance metrics.",

Both data sets exhibit a bell-shaped curve; however, discrepancies are noted, particularly in strain sensitivity which is greater in the experimental composite wire due to intrinsic or extrinsic factors. This highlights the complexities involved in replicating theoretical models in real-world conditions, crucial for improving strain tolerance in technological superconducting wires.",

The curve is superimposed with λω²_ln, a product function expected to correlate with N(E_F). The good agreement between the two underscores the co-influence of strain on both electronic and phononic aspects of the material's superconductivity, supporting the idea that strain modulations similarly influence electronic density and phonon frequency products.",

The Fermi level is set at 0 eV, highlighting that the tetragonal deformation does not significantly modify the electronic structure at the Fermi level. This constancy in electronic behavior across strains is crucial for understanding strain effects predominantly governed by phonon dynamics rather than electron-structural changes.",
