      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates the critical current (I_C) versus longitudinal strain for two ITER Nb3Sn strands, Luvata-8406 and OST-9355, under a magnetic field of 18 T at 4.2 K. In subplot (a), the I_C initially increases with applied strain reaching a maximum at ε_max, followed by a decline. Upon reducing the strain, the current does not fully recover to the initial maximum, indicating an irreversibility strain, ε_irr, where I_C becomes non-reversible. This experiment highlights that Luvata-8406 exhibits a higher irreversibility strain compared to OST-9355, reflecting its better performance under strain conditions relevant to coil design. This is crucial for high-field magnet applications requiring durable strands capable of withstanding significant mechanical stress without permanent degradation in superconducting properties【4:4†temp_paper_1e401fb623a64895e8d4a43f98a8c9ea.txt】.",

The figure shows a mechanical device designed with an air cylinder to apply transverse stresses to a U-shaped Nb3Sn strand via a puck. The setup ensures sample stress uniformity by electrical and mechanical design considerations, despite challenges posed by thermal mismatch and soldering materials. This apparatus is essential in understanding the mechanical robustness and superconductivity retention of Nb3Sn wires when used in high-stress environments like superconducting magnets【4:14†temp_paper_1e401fb623a64895e8d4a43f98a8c9ea.txt】.",

The plots reveal a clear monotonic decline in I_C as transverse stress increases, indicating sensitivity to mechanical pressures inherent in magnet operations. This behavior is typical of Nb3Sn strands and helps predict performance under realistic operational constraints. The study underscores the importance of selecting materials with optimal stress-strain sensitivities to minimize performance loss in high-field applications【4:18†temp_paper_1e401fb623a64895e8d4a43f98a8c9ea.txt】.",
