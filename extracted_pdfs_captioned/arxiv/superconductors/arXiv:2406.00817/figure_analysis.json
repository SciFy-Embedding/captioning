      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates the structural atomic arrangements of a Nb3Sn intermetallic compound using the A-15 lattice structure. Panel (a) shows the cubic unit cell with metal A atoms arranged in mutually orthogonal chains, marked with orange lines, and neighboring A atoms indicated with red circles to enhance chain transparency. The crystallographic 3D configuration of B atom sites mimics a simple body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice. Panel (b) reconstructs the structural motif of the Nb crystal lattice with Im3m space group symmetry, indicating active sites as crystallographic interstitials related to the tetrahedral position, marked with red balls. These configurations contribute to dense atomic packing crucial for enhancing superconductivity by affecting the electronic spectrum near the Fermi surface .",

Blue and red spheres depict niobium chain formations occupying distinct positions. The bottom part illustrates the arrangement of single crystal grains in a polycrystalline system, reflecting variation in chain orientation across the cubic axes, impacting the microstructural characteristics and inducing anisotropy during crystallization.",

The red region delineates the stable A-15 phase, crucial for maintaining superconductivity over variable Sn contents. The diagram underscores the stoichiometric constraints pivotal for achieving the desired superconducting phase, typically occurring between 18% to 26% Sn content where the critical temperature is optimized .",

Off-center displacements of niobium atoms along cubic crystallographic directions are visualized, constructed via DFT calculations. This structural evolution highlights niobium's role in stabilizing the lattice, fundamental for understanding how these transformations impact superconductivity through changes in local symmetry.",
