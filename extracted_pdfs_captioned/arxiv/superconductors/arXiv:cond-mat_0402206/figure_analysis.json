      "caption": "Figure 1 illustrates the maximum bulk pinning force (Fp_max) plotted against the irreversibility field (µ0 H_K). The data points represent measurements from a series of ten Powder-in-Tube (PIT) samples, conducted across temperatures from 4.2 K to 16 K. The figure captures data that collapse onto a single linear fit described by a mathematical equation indicated in the study. Notably, despite varying heat treatment durations (0.5 to 128 hours at 675°C) and temperatures, the data consistency underscores a universal behavior. Low-temperature data align with those obtained at 15 to 16 K (denoted by open symbols), which yield low H_K values but remain consistent with the lower-temperature data set under the defined equation. The significance of this figure lies in demonstrating the robustness and repeatability of bulk pinning force characteristics across varied experimental conditions, presenting critical insights into the performance of PIT superconductors.",

      "caption": "Figure 2 presents two graphs depicting the radial distribution of the critical current density per unit length (m_sim) plotted as a function of radius (R) at two conditions: (a) 4.2 K, 12 T, and (b) 12 K, 5 T. The plots also juxtapose these data with an 'Ideal' line, representing the theoretical maximum current density without any compositional inhomogeneities. Multiple profiles are shown, indexed by their radial position, reflecting varying heat treatments during simulations. The observed trends indicate that the current density diminishes rapidly close to the outer radius when radial composition gradients are present, especially under higher temperature conditions (12 K). This figure underscores how radial tin gradients critically alter superconductor performance by reducing current flow in outer layers, particularly at elevated temperatures.",

Each profile shows the moment reduction progressing to outer shells due to decreased Tin concentration gradients and superconductivity. This depletion effect is more prevalent at higher temperatures, where the outer sections do not exhibit superconductivity in zero fields. These plots highlight the necessity of maintaining an optimal Tin gradient to ensure maximum superconducting moment and efficient performance of PIT strands.",

The purpose is to analyze how radial tin concentration affects superconducting properties in Powder-in-Tube (PIT) Nb3Sn strands. Labels on the right axes show local critical temperatures and upper critical field values corresponding to these compositions. Profiles ranging from linear to a flat plateau with an abrupt transition near the Nb3Sn/Nb interface are considered. These profiles influence the superconducting properties, with higher N values representing a flatter gradient indicative of extended heat treatments. This visualization is critical for understanding how tin gradients impact the field and temperature-dependent superconducting behavior, offering insights crucial for optimizing heat treatment processes in Nb3Sn-based superconductors.",
