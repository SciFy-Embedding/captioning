      "caption": "Figure 4 displays two graphs related to grain size and magnetic field behavior in internally oxidized and conventional Nb3Sn samples. Part (a) plots F_p,max, the peak value of the pinning force density, against the reciprocal grain size, 1/d (μm^{-1}). Notably, as grain size decreases, particularly below ≈100 nm, F_p,max ceases to increase linearly and the relationship becomes nonlinear, indicating enhanced pinning efficacy in finely grained structures. Part (b) shows normalized F_p-B curves at 4.2 K for samples with different oxides and reaction conditions, presenting the broadening of peaks as grain sizes shrink, with highlighted shifts indicating structural phase changes influencing the performance in high magnetic fields.",

      "caption": "Figure 2 illustrates a TEM image of an internally oxidized Nb3Sn sample, reacted at 700 °C for 55 hours. The image identifies intra-grain and inter-grain ZrO_2 particles, which play a crucial role in refining grain size. These particles are responsible for pinning grain boundaries, thereby reducing grain growth and increasing uniformity. These observations highlight the effectiveness of internal oxidation in enhancing the microstructure, potentially leading to improved superconducting properties.",

Images (c-f) are SE images displaying fracture surfaces of strands reacted at different conditions, showing the progressed reaction through NbO2 and SnO2 at various temperatures and times. This figure visualizes structural transformations indicative of different grain size distributions and morphology evolution due to varying processing parameters.",

In (b), F_p-B curves are shown, indicating the relative strength of pinning forces versus magnetic field for each sample. The SnO2 samples surpassed NbO2, suggesting stronger vortex pinning due to finer microstructures.",

Subfigures: (a) and (b) illustrate samples reacted at 750 °C for 8 hours, whereas (c) and (d) contrast samples reacted at 850 °C for 40 minutes. The images demonstrate that internal oxidation leads to finer and more compact grain structures, particularly noticeable in samples reacted at the higher temperature. These findings underscore internal oxidation's efficacy in modulating layer growth kinetics for enhanced superconducting performance.",
