      "caption": "Figure 3 illustrates the back-bending of the nematic transition line Ts(x) (solid blue line) in the superconducting phase, shaded light yellow, highlighting the dynamic interplay between superconducting and nematic orders. The solid blue line represents the observed behavior of Ts(x), while the dashed blue line depicts the hypothetical transition without considering the superconducting interference. The x-axis on this graph corresponds to a tuning parameter that can relate to doping or pressure, and the y-axis is the temperature T normalized by an energy scale Λ. This phenomenon is critical for understanding the changes in the shear modulus cs(T) across a superconducting transition, which becomes significant when electron coupling surpasses a threshold. The figure is a crucial representation for demonstrating the discrepancy between expected linear behavior and the reality under the strong coupling conditions.",

      "caption": "Figure 2 shows a plot examining the temperature-dependent dynamics of the shear elastic constant cs(T) near a superconducting transition Tc, emphasizing the effects of nematic instability. The x-axis represents the temperature normalized to the superconducting transition temperature (T/Tc), while the y-axis shows the ratio of the shear elastic constant cs(T) to its baseline value at zero cs(0). The shaded regions signify different phases of the material as it transitions, with the left (yellow-shaded) possibly denoting a pre-superconducting or metallic phase, and the right (grey-shaded) a transition into superconductivity. The elastic constant behavior bifurcates into a hardening (dark red line) when the coupling constant λ0 is positive or a softening (light green line) when negative, indicative of complex interplay influenced by high nematic correlation lengths.",

      "caption": "Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram illustrating the coupling λ that moderates the interaction between superconducting and nematic orders detailed in Eq. [1] of the study. The diagram depicts λ as a four-point interaction function featuring two particle-hole vertices (open circles) with a nematic form factor h^k and two particle-particle vertices (closed circles). Solid lines represent electron Green's functions with wave vector k describing both momentum and frequency dependencies. This depiction plays a pivotal role in detailing how microscopic interactions influence macroscopic elastic properties across a superconducting transition.",
