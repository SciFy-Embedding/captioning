      "caption": "Figure 1 displays a schematic view of the Cs3C60 unit cell in the A15 structure, illustrating the orientation variations of fulleride anions positioned at the body center and the coordinate origin. Additionally, the image highlights the locations of the Cs cations within the structure. This visualization is significant for understanding the electronic structure and coordination within the material, crucial for analyzing the properties of Cs3C60 under different conditions such as pressure variations that influence superconducting and antiferromagnetic properties.",

      "caption": "Figure 3 shows the density of states (DOS) for the t1u valence bands of Cs3C60 obtained using the HSE functional under nonmagnetic (dashed blue line) and antiferromagnetic (solid red line) conditions. The key feature of the figure is the clear depiction of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) gap at approximately 0.25 eV, indicated by an arrow. This figure illustrates the stabilization of an AFM state when electron correlation effects are included, contrasting with results obtained through the PBE method that fails to produce such an insulating state. This implies the importance of hybrid functionals like HSE in capturing the electronic correlation effects vital in stabilizing the AFM state",

      "caption": "Figure 2 presents the density of states (DOS) of A15 Cs3C60 in a broad energy range calculated within the PBE framework. The plot distinguishes the molecular orbital contributions, focusing particularly on the t1u bands. The diagram compares a nonmagnetic solution, represented by a dashed blue line, against a metallic AFM solution shown by a solid red line. This analysis reveals that, despite structural predispositions, PBE fails to stabilize the observed AFM insulator state, leading to a purely metallic character due to inadequate electron correlation consideration. This insight points to an essential role of electron correlations, alignable with Mott physics, absent in the PBE energy landscape",
