FESEM-BSE images show the changes in microstructure after heat treatments at (a) 700 °C, (b) 750 °C, (c) 800 °C, and (d) 1000 °C, each for a duration of 3 hours. The images highlight that significant grain growth occurs only at the highest annealing temperature of 1000 °C, with minimal changes observed at lower temperatures.
