      "caption": "Figure 5 shows the distribution of coil stress under different conditions: at room temperature after assembly, at operational temperature and zero current, and at 1.9 K with a field gradient of 130 T/m. The stress analysis, performed using ANSYS with plastic properties of the coil material, reveals that the maximum room-temperature stress in the coil is 70 MPa, increasing to ~110 MPa after cooldown. This level of stress ensures the coil turns remain compressed even at a nominal gradient of 130 T/m. To safely operate at 150 T/m, the coil pre-stress would need to be increased to 90 MPa, with maximum stress not exceeding 170 MPa, supporting Nb3Sn magnet safety.",

      "caption": "Figure 1 provides the cross-sections of quadrupole coils with (left) and without (right) mid-plane spacers. The spacer's inclusion, 1 cm thick azimuthally, eliminates about four turns near each coil mid-plane, reducing areas with maximum radiation heat and dose. Both coil designs use a Rutherford-type cable with 40 strands. This configuration helps mitigate radiation-induced thermal effects, improving operational efficiency and extending magnet lifespan.",

The diagram highlights the relationship between operational current and magnetic field with and without mid-plane spacers. Due to the design's large distance between coil and yoke, saturation effects remain minimal, causing only minor variations in the b6 harmonic, maintaining performance within desired parameters.",
