      "caption": "This figure provides a schematic of an M-B/AnB/A diffusion reaction system in a planar geometry. In part (a), the system is illustrated with two interfaces: the M-B/AnB interface (I) and the AnB/A interface (II). This setup is essential to analyze the diffusion and reaction dynamics for different layers and interfaces. Part (b) presents the XB profiles across the system, indicating the concentration gradients that arise due to the diffusion process. This visualization is critical in understanding how the chemical potentials and reaction kinetics at interfaces contribute to the observed concentration profiles. Scientifically, this figure plays a crucial role in demonstrating the complex interactions and equilibrium conditions necessary for precise control of composition in multi-phase systems, significantly impacting the development and optimization of materials for high-performance applications like superconductors .",

      "caption": "This graph depicts the Sn concentration profile across a Cu-Sn/Nb3Sn/Nb system after various annealing periods at 650°C. The x-axis represents the distance in micrometers (μm), while the y-axis shows the Sn concentration in atomic percent (at.%). Different symbols and colors correspond to samples annealed for 65 h, 130 h, 320 h, and 600 h. Key findings indicate the evolution of Sn concentration gradients from the Cu-Sn through the Nb3Sn layer to the Nb, highlighting the changes in Sn content with increased annealing time. This figure is significant in understanding the thermal and compositional stability of the Nb3Sn layer, which is critical for its application as a superconductor.",

The figure outlines the migration of atoms along grain boundaries and their interaction with inter-phase interfaces, emphasizing the importance of grain boundary diffusion in controlling the layer composition. Time intervals t1, t2, and t3 are depicted, demonstrating progressive changes in atomic distribution and revealing how grain boundaries serve as pathways for diffusion, which is otherwise inhibited in the bulk. This schematic is fundamental to interpreting how microstructural features like grain boundaries can dominate diffusion processes, thereby influencing the properties and performances of materials like Nb3Sn superconductors .",
