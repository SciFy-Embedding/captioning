      "caption": "Figure 4: Displays subsequently recorded I-V curves at a fixed temperature of 15.8 K, main magnetic field μ₀H = 3 T, and shaking field frequency of 1 kHz. Panel (a) shows the curves with a current step-width of δI = 0.5 mA, and panel (b) with δI ≈ 0.2 mA. The voltage U (V) is plotted against the current I (mA). The key finding is the presence of a step feature in the I-V curves, particularly emphasized in lower current step-width cases, which may suggest intrinsic phase transition behaviors possibly linked to the peak effect. This indicates a disorder-driven non-thermal phase transition in the vortex lattice dynamics of Nb3Sn. Further studies are suggested to discern if the step feature is intrinsic to the Nb3Sn samples or results from sample inhomogeneity.",

The magnification highlights the features that become evident with careful current step-width modulation, emphasizing the reproducibility of the pattern. This magnification is crucial for examining the likelihood of the step feature being a first-order phase transition, which supports the broader study's assertion of a disorder-driven transition nature in the superconductor's phase behavior.",

The main figure shows the voltage U against current I, while the inset illustrates the linear dependence of the peak current Iₚ on μ₀hac. Key findings include a distinct voltage-dip pattern emerging in the presence of a shaking field and a notable step feature at approximately 13 mA for μ₀hac = 1 mT. These results underline the threshold amplitude for shaking fields that influence I-V characteristics and support the hypothesis of disorder-induced non-thermal phase transitions in Nb3Sn.",
