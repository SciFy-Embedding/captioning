The data, gathered by Testardi and colleagues, show a pronounced correlation between \\(T_c\\) and the resistance ratio across various sputtering conditions, compositions, and film thicknesses, demonstrating a universal trend. A notable finding is that superconductivity is absent when the resistance ratio is less than one. The theoretical curve shown aligns well with the experimental data, highlighting the consistency of the underlying theoretical model with observed phenomena【4:0†source】.",

The experimental data points are represented along with theoretical predictions, which match closely with the trends. The figure illustrates that as \\(\\rho_0\\) increases, \\(T_c\\) decreases for both materials, indicating a distinct superconducting degradation with increasing resistivity. This relationship highlights the sensitivity of these superconductors to disorder, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms affecting their superconducting properties【12:0†source】.",
