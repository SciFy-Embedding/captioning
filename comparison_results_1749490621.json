    "caption": "This figure shows a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) cross-section of a Nb3Sn multi-filamentary strand, highlighting the filamentary region composed of 19 filament bundles. Each bundle contains closely spaced superconducting filaments, separated by a tantalum diffusion barrier from the surrounding copper stabilization matrix. Labels a1, a2, and af indicate specific areas of interest within the filamentary structure. This visualization is significant as it provides insight into the internal structure of the strand, crucial for understanding current transfer and inter-filament resistance in superconducting applications.",

    "caption": "The figure presents a scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of a cross-section of an OST-I Nb3Sn superconducting wire, depicting the filamentary structure inside the Nb3Sn multifilamentary strand. The image shows the delineation between the filamentary zone (af), the region enclosed by the tantalum barrier (a1), and the entire wire structure (a2). The image is central to the study as it illustrates the microstructural configuration critical to understanding the transverse resistivity variations across different regions of the wire. This structural visualization aids in assessing the high contact resistance at the filament-to-matrix interface, attributed to inter-metallic layer formation during the Nb3Sn reaction heat treatment, and the role of the Ta barrier in maintaining separation between the filamentary zone and the copper stabilization matrix\u30104:7\u2020source\u3011.",
